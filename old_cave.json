    "lyrics": "Down in the willow garden, me and my love did meet\nAnd as we sat a-courting, my love fell off to sleep\nI had a bottle of burgundy wine; my love, she did not know\nAnd so I poisoned that dear little girl along the banks below\nAlong the banks below\n\nI drew my saber through her; it was a bloody night\nI threw her in the river, which was a dreadful sight\nMy father often told me that money would set me free\nAnd so I murdered that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly\nWhose name was Rose Connelly\n\nMy father sits at his cabin door wiping his tear-dimmed eyes\nHis only son soon should walk to yonder scaffold high\nMy race is run beneath the sun; the scaffold now waits for me\nFor I did murder that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly\nWhose name was Rose Connelly\nWhose name was Rose Connelly"

Oh I hate them, Pa!\nOh I hate them all for what they went and done to you\nOh Lord Oh my Lord\nOh Lord\nHow have I offended thee?\nWrap your tender arms round me\nOh Lord Oh Lord\nOh My Lord"

    "lyrics": "I am tall and I am thin\nOf an enviable hight\nAnd I've been known to be quite handsome\nIn a certain angle and in certain light \nWell I entered into O'Malley's\nSaid, \"O'Malley I have a thirst\"\nO'Malley merely smiled at me\nSaid \"You wouldn't be the first\" \nI knocked on the bar and pointed\nTo a bottle on the shelf\nAnd as O'Malley poured me out a drink\nI sniffed and crossed myself \nMy hand decided that the time was nigh\nAnd for a moment it slipped from view\nAnd when it returned, it fairly burned\nWith confidence anew \nWell the thunder from my steely fist\nMade all the glasses jangle\nWhen I shot him, I was so handsome\nIt was the light, it was the angle \nHuh! Hmmmmmm \n\"Neighbours!\" I cried, \"Friends!\" I screamed\nI banged my fist upon the bar\n\"I bear no grudge against you!\"\nAnd my dick felt long and hard \n\"I am the man for which no God waits\nBut for which the whole world yearns\nI'm marked by darkness and by blood\nAnd one thousand powder-burns\" \nWell, you know those fish with the swollen lips\nThat clean the ocean floor\nWhen I looked at poor O'Malley's wife\nThat's exactly what I saw \nI jammed the barrel under her chin\nAnd her face looked raw and vicious\nHer head it landed in the sink\nWith all the dirty dishes \nHer little daughter Siobhan\nPulled beers from dusk till down\nAnd amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke\nBut she pulled the best beer in town \nI swooped magnificent upon her\nAs she sat shivering in her grief\nLike the Madonna painted on the church-house wall\nIn whale's blood and banana leaf \nHer throat it crumbled in my fist\nAnd I spun heroically around\nTo see Caffrey rising from his seat\nI shot that mother fucker down \nMmmmmmmmmm Yeah Yeah Yeah \n\"I have no free will\", I sang\nAs I flew about the murder\nMrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed\nYou really should have heard her \nI sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept\nI panted like a pup\nI blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes\nAnd her husband stupidly stood up \nAs he screamed, \"You are an evil man\"\nAnd I paused a while to wonder\n\"If I have no free will then how can I\nBe morally culpable, I wonder\" \nI shot Richard Holmes in the stomach\nAnd gingerly he sat down\nAnd he whispered weirdly, \"No offense\"\nAnd then lay upon the ground \n\"None taken\", I replied to him\nTo which he gave a little cough\nWith blazing wings I neatly aimed\nAnd blew his head completely off \nI've lived in this town for thirty years\nAnd to no-one I am a stranger\nAnd I put new bullets in my gun\nChamber upon chamber \nAnd I turned my gun on the bird-like Mr. Brookes\nI thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows\nAnd as I shot down the youthful Richardson\nIt was St. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows \nHhhhhhhhhh Mmmmmmmmmmmm \nI said, \"I want to introduce myself\nAnd I am glad that all you came\"\nAnd I leapt upon the bar\nAnd shouted out my name \nWell Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool\nClosed his eyes and shrugged and laughed\nAnd with an ashtray as big as a fucking really big brick\nI split his head in half \nHis blood spilled across the bar\nLike a steaming scarlet brook\nAnd I knelt at it's edge on the counter\nWiped the tears away and looked \nWell, the light in there was blinding\nFull of God and ghosts of truth\nI smiled at Henry Davenport\nWho made an attempt to move \nWell, from the position I was standing\nThe strangest thing I ever saw\nThe bullet entered through the top of his chest\nAnd blew his bowels out on the floor \nWell I floated down the counter\nShowing no remorse\nI shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter\nRecently divorced \nBut remorse i felt and remorse I had\nIt clung to every thing\nFrom the raven's hair upon my head\nTo the feathers on my wings \nRemorse sqeezed my hand in it's fradulent claw\nWith it's golden hairless chest\nAnd I glided through the bodies\nAnd killed the fat man Vincent West \nWho sat quietly in his chair\nA man become a child\nAnd I raised the gun up to his head\nExecutioner-style \nHe made no attempt to resist\nSo fat and dull and lazy\n\"Did you know I lived in your street?\" I said\nAnd he looked at me as though I were crazy \n\"O\", he said, \"I had no idea\"\nAnd he grew as quiet as a mouse\nAnd the roar of the pistol when it went off\nNear blew that hat right off the house \nHmmmmmm Uh Uh \nWell, I caught my eye in the mirror\nAnd gave it a long and loving inspection\n\"There stands some kind of man\", I roared\nAnd there did, in the reflection \nMy hair combed back like a raven's wing\nMy muscles hard and tight\nAnd curling from the business end of my gun\nWas a query-mark of cordite \nWell I spun to the left, I spun to the right\nAnd I spun to the left again\n\"Fear me! Fear me! Fear me!\"\nBut no one did cause they were dead \nHuh! Hmmmmmmmmm \nAnd then there were the police sirens wailing\nAnd a bull-horn squelched and blared\n\"Drop your weapons and come out\nWith your hands held in the air\" \nWell, I checked the chamber of my gun\nSaw I had one final bullet left\nMy hand, it looked almost human\nAs I raised it to my head \n\"Drop your weapon and come out!\nKeep your hands above your head!\"\nI had one one long hard think about dying\nAnd did exactly what they said \nThere must have been fifty cops out there\nIn a circle around O'Malley's bar\n\"Don't shoot\", I cried, \"I'm a man unarmed!\"\nSo they put me in their car \nAnd they sped me away from that terrible scene\nAnd I glanced out of the window\nSaw O'Malley's bar, saw the cops and the cars\nAnd I started counting on my fingers \nAaaaaah One Aaaaaah Two Aaaaaah Three Aaaaaaah Four\nO'Malley's bar O'Malley's bar"

I'm a monster!

And Onward!  And Onward I go!\nOnward!  And Upward!  And I'm off to find love\nWith blue-black braclets on my wrists and ankles\nAnd the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle"

I took his wretched life\nNow I'm over near the bandstand\nEvery hand moving on John Finns' wife\nEvery hand moving on John Finns' wife\n\nAnd John Finns' wife\nTook all the flowers down\nFrom her hair\nAnd threw them on the ground\nAnd the flies did hum\nAnd the flies did buzz around\nPoor John Finn\nLying dead upon the ground\nLying dead upon the ground"

    "lyrics": "I went out walking the other day\nThe wind hung wet around my neck\nMy head it rung with screams and groans\nFrom the night I spent amongst her bones\nI passed beside the mission house\nWhere that mad old buzzard, the reverend,\nShrieked and flapped about life after your dead\nWell, I thought about my friend, Michel\nHow they rolled him in linoleum\nAnd shot him in the neck\nA bloody halo, like a think-bubble\nCircling his head\nAnd I bellowed at the firmament\nLooks like the rains are hear to stay\nAnd the rain pissed down upon me\nAnd washed me all away\nSaying\n\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nWell, the road is long\nAnd the road is hard\nAnd many fall by the side\nBut Papa won't leave you, Henry\nSo there ain't no need to cry\n\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\n\nWell, the moon it looked exhausted\nLike something you should pity\nSpent an age-spotted\nAbove the sizzling wires of the city\nWell, it reminded me of her face\nHer bleached and hungry eyes\nHer hair was like a curtain\nFalling open with the laughter\nAnd closing with the lies\nBut the ghost of her still lingers on\nThough she's passed through me\nAnd is gone\nThe slum dogs, they are barking\nAnd the rain children on the streets\nAnd the tears that we will weep today\nWill all be washed away\nBy the tears that we will weep again tomorrow\n\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nFor the road is long\nAnd the road is hard\nAnd many fall by the side\nBut Papa won't leave you, Henry\nSo there ain't no need to cry\n\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\n\nAnd I came upon a little house\nA little house upon a hill\nAnd I entered through, the curtain hissed\nInto the house with its blood-red bowels\nWhere wet-lipped women with greasy fists\nCrawled the ceilings and the walls\nThey filled me full of drink\nAnd led me round the rooms\nNaked and cold and grinning\nUntil everything went black\nAnd I came down spinning\nI awoke so drunk and full of rage\nThat I could hardly speak\nA fag in a whale-bone corset\nDraping his dick across my cheek\nAnd its into the shame\nAnd its into a guilt\nAnd its into the fucking fray\nAnd the walls ran red around me\nA warm arterial spray\nSaying\n\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nWell, the night is dark\nAnd the night is deep\nAnd its jaws are open wide\nBut Papa won't leave you, Henry\nSo there ain't no need to cry\n\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\n\nIt's the rainy season where I'm living\nDeath comes leaping out of every doorway\nWasting you for money, for your clothes\nAnd for your nothing\nEntire towns being washed away\nFavelas exploding on inflammable spillways\nLynch-mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains\nThe mad heat and the relentless rains\nAnd if you stick your arm into that hole\nIt comes out shit up to the bone\nAnd with her kisses bubbling on my lips\nI swiped the rain and nearly missed\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nSinging\n\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nPapa won't leave you, Henry\nPapa won't leave you, Boy\nWell, the road is long\nAnd the road is hard\nAnd many fall by the side\nBut Papa won't leave you, Henry\nSo there ain't no need to cry\n\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nAnd I went on down the road\nHe went on down the road\nBent Beneath my heavy load\nUnder his heavy load\nYeah, I went on down the road\nYeah, he went on down the road\n\nWoah, woah\nWoah, woah\nWoah, woah\nWoah, woah\nAnd I went on down that road"

    "lyrics": "As I walk these narrow streets\nWhere a million passin feet have trod before me\nWith my guitar in my hand\nSuddenly I realize nobody knows me\n\nWhere yesterday the multitude\nScreamed and cried my name out for a song\nToday the streets are empty\nAnd the crowds have all gone home\n\nI pass a million houses\nBut there is no place that I belong\nAll I knew to give you\nWas song after song after song\n\nAll the truths I tried to tell you\nWere as distant to you as the moon\nBorn 200 years too late\nAnd 200 years too soon\n\nI'm a child of this age\nLocked into the pages of your book\nAnd when I am but dust and clay\nAnd all the children stop to take a look\n\nWill they marvel at the miracles I did perform\nAnd the heights I did aspire\nOr will they tear out the pages of the book\nTo light a fire\n\nWith the rain on my face\nThere is no place that I belong\nDid you forget this fucking singer so soon?\nAnd did you forget my song?"
