This script, were it ever to be used, would scrape various websites for lyrics by artist name. I don't have permission to do any of this, and I don't recommend that you run this script. I have myself never run it.

Hypothetically, if you were to run it, you'd do something like this:Run this by typing:

`npm start -- "Artist Name"`

and you'll get `Artist Name.json` in this folder when it finishes.
