He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
That man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Ohooooo I knowooooo, should've let go, but no
'Cause he is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm
His lucky charm
So I guess it's OK
He's with me
And I hear people talk people talk
Try to make remarks
Keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care
'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy
Ohooooo I knowooooo
Mama I'm in love with a criminal
Should've let go
And this type of love isn't rational,
Ohooooo I knowooooo
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
Should've let go
All reason aside
I just can't deny, love the guy
It 's not the flowers,
wraped in fancy paper.
it's not the ring,
I wear around my finger.
There's nothing in all the world I need,
When I have you here beside me.
Here beside me
So you could give me wings to fly,
and catch me if I fall.
Or pull the stars down from the sky,
so I could wish on them all.
But I couldn't ask for more.
cause your love is the greatest gift of all.
In your arms, I found a strenth inside me
And in your eyes, there's a light to guide me.
I would be lost without you.
and all that my heart could ever want
has come true
You could offer me,
The sun, the moon
and i would still belive
you gave me everything
when you gave your heart to me.
But i couldn't ask for more
cause your love is the greatest gift of all.
your love is the greatest gift of all
the greatest gift of all
YOU WILL NEVER
You are weak in me
I can feel it
but do you think I care
If you cry
I will laugh at you
I'm sick of stroking your hair
Could you take it
can you make it
don't wanna fake it
So don't you say that
love is a fight
you don't know what it's like to die
You will never feel it coming, feel it coming
If you choose to walk away from love
You'll be gone and I'll be coming
I am free, I am me
I am breathing
the air that's rightfully mine
Drew the line
you had to go this time
drove the message into your spine
Couldn't take it
couldn't make it
I didn't fake it
Now you can say that
love is a fight
'cause you know what it's like, you died
I was the game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best
Don't you know
Don't you know
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
You've got it all over
You've got it all over
Now, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you
I let go
Oh you can surely see
You're so much more to me
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best yeah...
Don't you know
Don't you know
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true so true
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call
You went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not all that he's not
Just look what I've got look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all you've got it all
All over him
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true so true
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call
You went out on a limb out on a limb
And you're all that he's not all that he's not
Just look what I've got look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all you've got it all
You've got it all over
All over uh, huh
You've got it all over
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that Somthin, what can I do
Baby, you stood me around
The Earth is movin, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin, it's easy to see
Lovin you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
You Drive me crazy
I just cant sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in to deep
Ohh...Crazy, But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin of you keeps me up all night
Tell Me, Your so into me
That i'm the only one you will see
Tell me, im not in the blue
That i'm not wastin' my feelins on you
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in to deep
Crazy, But it feels alright
Every Day and Every Night
You Drive Me Crazy You drive me crazy baby
Ohh..Crazy, But It Feels Alright
Baby Thinkin of you keeps me up all night
Baby Thinkin of you keeps me up all night
Think you're going nowhere
When you're walking down the street
Acting like you just don't care
When life could be so sweet
Why you wanna be like that
As if there's nothing new
You're not fooling no one
You're not even fooling you
So walk a little slower
And open up your eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to see
The good things passing by
There might never be a sign
No flashing neon light
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right
So Why not Why not
Take a crazy chance
Why not Why not
Do a crazy dance
If you lose a moment
You might lose a lot
So why not
Take a crazy chance
Take a crazy chance
You always dress in yellow
When you wanna dress in gold
Instead of listening to your heart
You do just what you're told
You keep waiting where you are
For what you'll never know
Let's just get into your car
And go baby go
I could be the one for you
Maybe yes, maybe no
It could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is
You gotta let me know
You'll never get to heaven
Or even to L.A.
If you don't believe there's a way
Take a star from the sky
Spread your wings and fly
It might take a little
And it might take a lot
But why not
Sooooooooo...I got on the bus
I looked for a seat
but I couldn't find no place to sit
I had a chat
with a older man
about 25 years older than me
We began to touch
We wanted to explore our bodies and bring up the heat
He ripped off my top
fondled my breasts
and i just couldn't take anymore of this
I reared back
to knock him out
but he grabbed me and stuck his beep in my mouth
He raped me
and I decided I was gonna be a ho for one day...I am a girl
and girls just want some love...doesn't...maaater
cause I'll never ever see him again...yeah
Well a month later
I took a test
and it said that i was impregnant
I looked for the man

Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win
I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering
Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go
I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity
But, I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering
I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh baby, I just want to know
I love to hear you say that you love me
With words so sweet
And I love the way with just one whisper
You tell me everything
And when you say those words
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it
I love all the ways that you show me
You'll never leave
And the way your kisses, they always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
And I love the love your touch conveys
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it, say it
And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah x3
When I get you home
Babe, that's when the fun starts
It's just me and you
You and me
Our own private party
When I get you home
I saw you at the club, oh  yeah
In a corner by yourself
I chatted you up and, oh
We grinded, yeah babe
I can't wait, I can't wait...
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna get close up and personal.
Don't be scared...I won't bite...
Oh baby, baby, when I get you home...
We all have one true love
Somewhere in this world
I do I do, I do
When it seemed
All my dreams
Were falling through
That's when I found you
I believe for every heart
That whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere
It was sink
When the tide came in
I found myself
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you
I believe I believe
For every door Every door
For every heartbreak
There's hope for something new
From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise
It still flickered in your eyes
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you
A life unfolds
No one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone
More than you could ever know
You show deep love
When I found you I found love
Oooh the closest thing to heaven
I found you baby, I found you
I found you
I found myself
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you, you
What's Going On
Lord help us
There's too many of you crying
Oh, brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Oh my father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see war is not the answer
Nona GayeBackstreet Boys
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Barricades, can't block our way
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
Destiny's ChildBritney Spears
Oh what's going on
What's going on
Yeah what's going on
Ahh what's going on
What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on
Ah tell me
What's going on in the world today
I'd rather be dead
Than turn my head away
We gotta first world vision to comfty, to lift our
Hands in the air and cry for a switch
Father help us, come on
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Together we can all be strong
United we stand, United we fall
Oh you know we've got to find a way
Mary J. Blige
To bring some understanding here today
Barricades can't block our way
Darren Hayes Savage Garden
Don't punish me with brutality
Baby talk to me
So you can see
Yeah, what's going on
Hey, what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's goin' onuh
What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got momma's crying out please
My baby hold on
My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul
I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos and Asians
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure
It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me right
I can't be watching people die
And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and me
There's plenty of room for some humanity
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
what's going on
You used to say that I was special,
Everything was right,
But now you think I'm wearing too much makeup,
That my dress is too tight.
You got no reasons to be jealous,
I've never been untrue,
So does it really matter if they're lookin,
I'm only lookin at you.
You should never try to change me,
I can be nobody else, and I like the way I am.
What you see is what you get.
This is me, hey you,
If you want me don't forget,
You should take me as I am.
'Cuz I can promise you, baby what you see is what you get.
I know you watch me when I'm dancin',
When I'm partying with my friends.
I can feel a rise in my back, baby.
I can't help the chains around me, baby can't you see,
I can be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free.
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else, and I like the way I am.
What you see is what you get.
This is me, hey you,
If you want me don't forget,
You should take me as I am.
'Cuz I can promise you, baby what you see is what you get.
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else...
Believe me, you'll be lookin for trouble,
If you hurt me, I can promise
You, you'll be lookin for trouble,
What you see is what you get.
This is me, hey you,
If you want me don't forget,
You should take me as I am.
'Cuz I can promise you, baby what you see is what you get.
'Cuz I can promise you, baby what you see is what you get
ah, ah ah
ah, ah ah
Because I'm down with you everyday
There you say
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile
And no words they tell me
Quit with this appeal
You speak and there is no other
Voice that I can hear
I spend my days
I spend my nights
Thinkin' about you 2x
You're so fine
On my mind
And I think about you
All the time
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight
Each day that I spend around you
Passes by to fast
That I spend without you
Is longer than the last
You know I can't get
enough of you
You know that 24 hours
won't ever, ever do
I guess this is what love is
A very strange and mysterious thing
All these mixed up feelings
Can toy with someone's head
If you're not careful
Things can get out of control
You might not be in love anymore
Take it slow
Take it slow
Love can mean many different things
There are upsides
There are downsides
Look up, you have someone new to love
And spend time with when you really need someone
Look down, you have almost no free time
No time to just be you and you alone
I guess this is what love is
This is what love is
Some can live without love
Some can't live without
Some people, they just don't know
What love is all about
Love is a many splendored thing
It can put you right where you belong
I guess this is what love is
I guess this is what love is
Is. . .
I know that this is
I know that this is
I know that this is. . .
That this is what love is

I'm coming down with a heartache tonight
Only you can make it all right
If I can be with you holding me tight
There won't be no in my life
Everywhere I turn, I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Everytime you smile, angels cry
Everytime you walk on by
I'm not the only, feeling lonely
Everytime you walk on by
I try to say something, but end up with nothing
Everytime you walk on by
Everytime you walk on by...
I keep my cool and pretend I'm not here
Everytime you come too near
I'm such a fool 'cause
This love is true and
If I don't tell you, someone else surely will
Everywhere I turn, I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Everytime you smile, angels cry

This craziness must find an end

Take my hand
Why are we
Why are we
Our love was strong?
Our love was strong
Why carry on without me?
Why carry on without me?
Me, me, me
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
What have i done?
You seem to move on easy
Ohhhh. . .
I may have made it rain
May have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
Caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
Ohhhh. . .
Ooooh. . .
At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away
I guess I need you, baby
This song's my sorry
I guess I need you, baby
Baby, can't you see
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
I'm lovin? it
Can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning ?round and ?round
Do you feel me now
With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic
It's getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
It's taking over me
Can't come down
It's in the air
And it's all around
Can you feel me now
With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic
Don't you know that you're toxic
With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
To the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to go places I can be out of control
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world tonight
So I can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly
I love myself, it's not a sin
I can't control what's happening
Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
The small of my back, the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me
I'm holding my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I went to myself, I'm almost rushing in
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world tonight
So I can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly
Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
There's so little undefined
In my body and mind
I won't be left behind
I'm already here
Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
Hey hey hey oh oh
Hey hey hey oh oh

I woke up this mornin' couldn't walk
I opened the window couldn't talk
I tried to smile my teeth went missing
I couldnt find my heart out the lock
I waited till sunday couldn't sleep
All the time Oh counting sheep

someone to share my home
And now I've got you, your here
Standing with me,oh Strength my dear
My heart was broken but it's ok
I'll see you more each day
Oh, oh, ohoh
Friends say, I'm away
Because I'm down with you every day
They say, break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile and the words they tell me quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other voice that I can hear

For every heartbreak,
There's hope for something new
From the ashes arise,
A glimps of paradise
Theres a flicker in your eyes,
When I found you.

Yes I found, the deepest love I knew
I believe, yes its true

Our life unfolds

Tingling in my skin

More than you could ever know,
Its your deep love
When I found you

Everywhere I turn, I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Everytime you smile
Every time you walk on by
I'm not the only
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
I keep my cool and pretend I'm not here
Every time you come to near
I'm such a fool, 'cause,
this love is true
and, if I don't tell someone else should and will
Every where I turn, I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time smile

Didn’t really care ‘bout me
You might think that I can’t take it, but you’re wrong
‘Cause now I’m...
Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My lonliness ain’t killing me no more

Here I go, on my own
I don’t need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now

Here I go, here I go...
Here I go, here I go...
You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous

After the screaming’s at an end
Why don’t we do it all again
That’s when the fun really begins
Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
â€'Cause if we break up
Then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown
Here comes the showdown, oh
What goes around comes around
The crowds are waiting, oh
Here comes the showdown, oh
You know I'm one of a kind
Boy what's this I see,
This girl she looks just like me,
Blond hair and dressed to a T,
You tell me how can this be,
If she knew I was the one,
Who used to turn you on,
But you don't want to talk about it
When you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
That she can't do the thing I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face and my name
And it eats you up inside
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me
Why can't you see it girl
Got no identity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
Does she know I was the one
Who use to turn you on, yeah
But you don't want to talk about it
When you think you can find someone
to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
She don't do the things I do
You can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside
Your body’s warm
But you are not
You give a little
Not a lot
You coup your love
Until we kiss
You’re all I want
But not like this
I’m watching you disappear
But you, you were never here
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon
Your body gives
But then holds back
The sun is bright
The sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn’t mine
You left and it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon
How can I tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
I’m watching you disappear
But you, you were never here
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
It’s only your shadow
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction
When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, this what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction
When I'm watchin' my TV
and that girl comes on to tell me
how tight my skirts should be
well she can't tell me who to be
cause I've got my own identity.
I can't get no, oh no no no
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no, satisfaction
I can't get no, satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction baby

Not a day goes by
That I don't stop
And thank the stars for you
Each time I stare in your dark eyes
I'm reminded that you were mine
The world may pass us by
But my love will always linger for you
Angels come to play in the light
Of your smile
I'm the one that will kiss you
I'm the one that will hold you
I'm the one that was there to love you
With my soul
I maybe gone today
But you will forever be sacred
Sacred in my heart, mind and soul
Yes, you were mine
The day you came into my life
It was a natural high
Earth seemed to be a new place
With you here by my side
Your face alone can send me to tears
Joy filled my heart when you said you would always be there
I'm the one that will kiss you
I'm the one that will hold you
I'm the one that was there to love you
With my soul
You maybe gone today
But you will forever be sacred
Sacred in my heart, mind and soul
Yes, you were mine
Can't believe we're through
I waited for you all my life, all my life
I know for sure you were my last
But I know this love will be sacred for eternity
You maybe gone today
But you will forever be sacred
Sacred in my heart, mind and soul

Oops!.. I Did It Again!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes it is"
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"
"Oh, you shouldn't have"
Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops!...You think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and?
I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way
I don't want to wait
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you
I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and?
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and?
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
they say in this world
love cant last forever,
but i dont believe thats true
cause the way that i feel
when we are together
i know thats the way
ill always feel for you
from now until forever
thats how long ill be true
ill make you this vow
and promise you now until forever

they'll come a day
when the world stop turning
and stars will fall from the sky

and promise you now until forever

Always laughin at stupid things

Yes she is my best friend
Yes she is my best friend
After this year will be the end

and meetin new people
But I will never have another friend like Amanda
The girl who is like my sister
The girl who is always there for me no matter what
I will n ever have another friend like Amanda

the girl who is always there for me no matter what
I will be here for her whenever she needs
no matter what time
no matter what time of the day...
Amanda is a wonderful girl
always smilin at somethin

and that is why she is my best friend
She will be my best friend until the end
I am gonna hate it when we say good bye

Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, and how she suddenly fell huh
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I am taking over, to release her from her spell
She's unforgettable, she's a legend though
It's kinda pitiful that she's gone
It's kinda incredible
She's so predictable yeah, yeah
It's time to let her go yeah cuz she's gone, cuz she's gone, cuz she's gone
She was taken under, drowning in her seat huh
Running like an angel, she was crying but she could not see oh no!
Now see everyone's watching, as she starts to fall
Now don't have a breakdown
You will hit the freakin wall
Now Ladies does that make you cryyyyyyy? huh

Feeling sad and all alone
I thought I was going crazy, baby
I thought the pain would last forever
I thought he'd never ever hurt me, and hurt me
Over and over again
When you tried into my world
You showed the loving ways of how
A guy should treat a girl
The love you give that makes me breathe again
I've found someone who feels me
An understanding friend till the end
I know the future no one can see
But I feel deep in my heart
You will stay with me eternally
So just love me
Even every day
And hold me in your arms now
Please love the hurt away
I'll make it go away, yes I will
Oh hurt away ohhh
I see heaven in your eyes
Tell me why would he make you cry, and lie
He must have been out of his mind
I would never hurt you baby
Don't let one fool turn you cold oh no
You've got a heart of gold
Heart Of gold
I love everything about you
All I know is
Every word I take it straight to you
A special part I give for everything I do
Nobody else comes close to the love you give
Body and soul
I'm gonna love you for as long as I live
And I know
It's not easy letting go No it's not easy
But I won't let you fall
Together you and me
We've got it all
I just love you
More and more each day
I rest my head on your shoulder
Please love the hurt away
Love the hurt away
I know the future no one can see
But I feel deep in my heart
You will stay with me eternally
I just love you
More and more each day
No, oh Please love the hurt away ohh yeah

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say?
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say?
"Best actress, and the winner is'Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my god'here she comes!"
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there's nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
LOVE TO HATE YOU
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
For seven months and fifteen days
I've been telling you lies in different ways
I know things will change
But I don't know when
You keep talking about us
Like we still were friends
I just hate the way you talk to me
I just love to say what's bothering me
I love to hate you
I really love to hate you
And nothing you do
Will ever change my mind
I'm doing fine
It wasn't meant to be like this
All you gave her was one little innocent kiss
I didn't believe
She would turn to be
The love of your life
Just like me
I just hate the way you talk to me
I just love to say what you mean to me
I love to hate you
I really love to hate you
And nothing you do
Will ever change my mind
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I love to hate you
I really love to hate you
And nothing you do
Will ever change my mind
I'm doing fine
I love to hate you

HAVE A NICE DAY
In my dreams I wish that I could see
A paperboy just hanging from a tree
I don't care if you're nice to me
We'll never meet again
And everybody cares so much
But I don't give a damn
Have a nice day
I couldn't care less if you do
Have a nice day
I wouldn't spend my time with you
Have a nice day
Every night when I go back to bed
My evil thoughts are spinning in my head
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I don't care if you're mad
Cause everybody cares so much
But I don't give a damn
Have a nice day
I couldn't care less if you do
Have a nice day
I wouldn't spend my time with you
Have a nice day

Você está sempre muito ocupado
Por que não vem comigo?
Não aja como se não me escutasse
Você é o culpado
Ele percebeu que eu estava só
Comecei a ser simpática
Ele me disse que eu era muito bonita
Não tenho nenhuma razão para mentir
Já te disse mil vezes
Eu precisei de você ao meu lado
Mas você não estava por perto
Você me deixou abandonada à própria sorte
Agora tudo está confuso
Você foi longe demais
Partiu meu coração
E agora, meu Deus?
Não posso mais usar você
O que irei fazer
Para satisfazer meus desejos?
Creio que isso me torna culpada
Pare de perguntar isso
Eu te queria tanto, é um perigo
A verdade é que agora você me aponta o dedo
E me declara culpada
Você não faz isso tão bem assim
Tão bom para 
Não fiz isso de propósito
O veredicto não é nada
Não tenho nenhuma razão para mentir
Já te disse mil vezes
Eu precisei de você ao meu lado
Mas você não estava por perto
Você me deixou abandonada à própria sorte
Agora tudo está confuso
Você foi longe demais
Partiu meu coração
E agora, meu Deus?
Não posso mais usar você
O que irei fazer
Para satisfazer meus desejos?
Creio que isso me torna culpada
Eu não choro
Não há nada perdido
Por isso decidi cantar uma música sobre 
Nos corações das garotas sendo partidos
Eu estava por fora
Você ali, sentado, dizendo que eu sou semvergonha
Quando você é o único que faz com que eu me sinta culpada
Você me deixou abandonada à própria sorte
Agora tudo está confuso
Você foi longe demais
Partiu meu coração
E agora, meu Deus?
Não posso mais usar você
O que irei fazer
Para satisfazer meus desejos?
Você me deixou abandonada à própria sorte
Agora tudo está confuso
Você foi longe demais
Partiu meu coração
E agora, meu Deus?
Não posso mais usar você
O que irei fazer
Para satisfazer meus desejos?
Creio que isso me torna culpada
GIVE ME LOVE
Such a long time ago, I found you
in the street with your friends
your friends were so strung out
And I was taken in by your false blue eyes
your kiss feels like a drug, your touch feels like the sky
What am I supposed to do with someone as screwed up as you
What am I supposed to do, when my heart is stuck on you
Give me love
Give me all that you got
Take me, forget the drugs
Give me love
Give me love
Take me, forget the drugs
I wanna come around today, but something is in my way
I'm scared to be there, I don't know what I might see
Demons make a fool of you, I know what you're going through
but the night won't be long, tomorrow they'll be gone
So what am I supposed to do with someone as lost as you
So what am I supposed to do when my heart is stuck on you
Give me love...
Lying in bed, touching my skin
Oh God I wish you weren't sleeping
I long for your lips, to kiss me again
Don't you know my body's aching?
Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to fade
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys
Will make love together
I look at your face, As I lie awake
Our bodies slowly moving closer
My hand on your leg
My mouth on its way
Oh baby, I'll just turn you over
Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, uh I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys boys
Will make love together...
Love together, love together,
Love together, love together,
Do you like this? I like this
I want you alright
Do you wanna touch me?
I like this
Can you handle this?
I like this
We've gotta slow it down,
Just a little bit
I'm lying in bed, touching my skin
I just can't take it baby
Open your eyes, whisper to me..
Do it again, do it again
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys boys
Will make love together
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But Good girls, and good little boys boys
Will make love together
Love together, love togther,
That's good, do you like this?
Yeah, gonna slow it down
We'll make love together
There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did
There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do
If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do
I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
I can't believe what I see no....
The girl in my mirror
The girl in my mirror is me
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonigh
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do
It's Britney bitch

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, I still miss you somehow
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart
"Baby," I said, "please stay.
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart
Through my dreams through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
I'm all alone in bed
and I can't sleep, I'm feeling blue.
I try to close my eyes
but all I'm thinking of is you.
Baby only you
I cry my eyes out baby
wondering what I have to do.
I lookin' inside my heart
and knows for sure this love is true!
Day by day, heart to heart
I hope that we will ever be together.
Will it be me and you
I dream that our love will last forever...
Hold me tight in your arms
I know we haven't straight this thing together.
Walk with me
hand in hand.
I promise to be there forever.
Day by day...
Hold me tight..

Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me
Everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move uneasy
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way
What have I done
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change.
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found it seems like we can't go wrong.
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
'Cause love you so
Ohhoohh I want you for the rest of my life.
Some people search what seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this
And here we are
With everything we wished for
I never felt such bliss.
There comes a chance in everyones life
And I beleive it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I want spend forever
And ever with you.
Deep in my heart
Deep in my heart
I want you for the rest of my life
I want you for the rest of my life.

Like I got what you need
Get on up and,
Why dont you do somethin'?
Now you all in my grill
Cause I say what I feel
Only rocks on what's real

Only here with my crew

Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why dont you just move along?
I see you lookin' over here
Cant you tell I'm havin' fun
If you care like I know
You would stop
starrin' at us
And get your own space
And do somethin'
Why dont you do somethin'?
He found a letter from his lover
She said she's never coming home
His things were lying on her doorstep
And his tears, they fell like rain
And in his mind, he knew
He'd love her always
Despite the tears
And in this town where few knew love
He'd spend his nights all alone, crying
And all the love he'd once shared with her
Was gone, long, long, long gone
And he knew a part of him was dying
And in his mind
He knew he'd love her always
Despite the tears
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Lover we tried, we tried, we tried
And in his mind he knew he'd love her always
Despite the tears
Today I saw a boy
And I wondered if he noticed me
He took my breath away
I can't get him off my mind
And it scares me
'Cause I've never felt this way
No one in this world
Knows me better than you do
So diary I'll confide in you
Today I saw a boy
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me
And I wondered
Does he know what's in my heart
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe
Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say
One touch of his hand
Now I can't wait to see that boy again
And I thought my heart could fly
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
That man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Ohooooo I knowooooo, should've let go, but no
'Cause he is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm
His lucky charm
So I guess it's OK
He's with me
And I hear people talk people talk
Try to make remarks
Keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care
'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy
Ohooooo I knowooooo
Mama I'm in love with a criminal
Should've let go
And this type of love isn't rational,
Ohooooo I knowooooo
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
Should've let go
All reason aside
I just can't deny, love the guy

But all that doesn't matter when I'm out with my hommies
Drop your drinks

When I'm on the floor, push aside my image
This is no animation
It's just a song
and it goes boom
Boom what? boom where? boom how? boom when?

By your side
Light my girl up
Watch your step, it's getting kinda blurry

Boom when you hear it
Boom when you feel it
Boom when you sing it

Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
Wait till you have reached the age
History has turned the page
We still want to hear a brand new thing
We still need a song to sing
And the beat goes on 6x
Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
Love is a thirsting, lasting on my mind
From tomorrow until the end of time
And the beat goes on 4x
And the beat goes
And the beat goes
And the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss
And the beat goes on 4x
Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain
Well our kids are turning faster everyday everyday
We still want to dance the night away
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on...

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
but summer love will keep us warm long after
our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Thinkin' of you and the love of our lives
in the sweet summertime
so sad but true so true, so true
we must leave it behind
in our hearts, in our minds
From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
Memories can fade
but my heart has a place for the smile on your face
and maybe someday
we can be more than friends
love will find us again
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
on the time that we borrowed
From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
I remember baby
We'll leave behind the summertime
our hearts, our minds
they will remind
we won't forget
the day we met
the day we cried
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
but summer love will keep us warm long after
our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

Hi This Is Britney Spears
My Friend Can't
Come To The Phone
And This Is One
Of Those Times
So Leave A Message
At The Beep
they'll Call You Back
One More Time
And Thanks For Calling!
Hit Me Baby One More Time
Hi! What's up this is Brit.
I'm not in right now
so do your thing..
I'm just kidding
Britney, you're a nerd.
You really need to change that message,
Look, I was thinking about that movie we saw the other night,
you know, how she had all that fame and all that money,
and she still wasn't happy..
Wouldn't that make a cool song
I saw him standin' there in the parking lot
He asked if I came here a lot
And this is how I responded
I forgot my name, I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address, damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this bra
I get amnesia when I'm standin' next to you
He's been with me for several years I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
I talk to my girls, I can talk to my girls like crazy
To anyone I speak my mind, I tell 'em off, it don't phase me
I'm not lazy but boy, lately
When I see you I stutter, words just slip away like butterflies
I saw you standin' there in the VIP on Friday
We conversate up in my fantasies, like everyday
But I'm a dud whenever you approach
Like yesterday when you just came to say hello
I forgot my name, I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address, damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this bra
I get amnesia when I'm standin' next to you
He's been with me for several years I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
Me, me, this is how I do
I talk to most guys, I can talk to most guys like crazy
To anyone I speak my mind, I tell 'em off, it don't phase me
But you shake me, boy you make me
Stop and stutter, when we touch I melt like butter
I saw you standin' there in the VIP on Saturday
Now that I know you got a thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let any guy get close
All I can say is I'mma tell my guy he should just effin go
And forget my name, and forget my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
'Cause I forgot my address, damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this bra
I get amnesia when I'm standin' next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
Me, me, this is how I do
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, and it just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa can you hear me?
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me, someone to hold
He'll be all my own in a big red bow
Santa can you hear me?

We'll be all alone, under the mistletoe

Underneath my Christmas tree

Voulezvous voir un monde étrange
Où l'on aime les démons et pas les anges ?
Suiveznous, venez visiter
Notre magnifique cité.
Voici Halloween, voici Halloween,
Les citrouilles vont mourir de trouille !
C'est ça Halloween,
Tout le monde a mauvaise mine.
C'est normal ! C'est pour terroriser les citrouilles!
Minuit sonne... C'est l'heure du crime !
Bienvenue à Halloween !
Moi je me cache sous votre lit le soir.
Mes dents, mes yeux brillent dans le noir.
Moi je me cache sous votre escalier,
Doigts de serpents et cheveux d'araignées.
C'est ça Halloween, c'est ça Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween ! Halloween ! Halloween !
C'est la ville de la nuit...
Les citrouilles chantent et les chauves sourient !
On plaisante, on fait des bêtises,
On ne sait pas quelle sera la prochaine surprise !
Au coin de la rue, il y a des inconnus
Qui surgissent des poubelles pour vous faire...
... Peur !
C'est ça Halloween !
Rouge et noir...
... Gélatine !
Quelle horreur !
C'est un enfer !
Par le feu, par la glace,
Il faut jouer à pile ou face
Et s'envoler à tombeau ouvert !
C'est la ville du crime ! C'est la ville du crime !
Bienvenue à Halloween !
Je perds la tête, quelquefois je l'arrache
Avant de disparaître dans un flash.
Je suis le mort qui prend le mors aux dents...
Je suis le vent qui vous glace le sang...
Moi, je me glisse comme une ombre noire
Et je transforme vos rêves en cauchemars !
C'est ça Halloween, c'est ça Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Y'a des enfants beaucoup trop sages...
On préfère ceux qui ont la rage !
On fait peur...
... Mais on se domine,
Dans le ville d'Halloween !
On plaisante, on fait des bêtises,
Tout le monde attend la prochaine surprise !
Si Jack le squelette,
Sans tambours ni trompettes,
Surgit dans votre dos,
Vous ne ferez pas de vieux os !
C'est ça Halloween !
C'est la ville du crime,
Bienvenue à l'épouvantable épouvantail !
Bravo Jack !
T'es un crack !
Vive notre nouveau roi !
Jack la gargouille
Est le roi des citrouilles !
C'est ça Halloween, c'est ça Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
C'est la ville de la nuit...
Les citrouilles chantent et les chauves sourient !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween...
They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I
still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
She wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"
He wants the young American
Young American, young American,
he wants the young American
He wants the young American
Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have been the unAmerican?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afroSheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
I heard the news today, oh boy
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can
sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
I want the young American
You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could go on if you wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
If you wanted to, yeah
You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could go on if you wanted to, wanted, wanted to
Wanted to, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh, if you wanted to
If you wanted to, yeah, yeah
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND
 Album Black Tie White Noise
Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grill
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a blackhearted vile thing
It's the nature of being
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
When the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a blackhearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
but you've changed me
You've been around
can't pass you by
You've been around
but you've changed me
You've been around
can't pass you by
You've been around
but you've changed me
Beauty shrieks "Beast in booties"
Coming home so lay the table
Look at you calling shots
Call you over under out
I was under, backwards, forwards
Holding hands in the dark
Kissing some, kissing cousins
Kissing this in cover
Kissing cousins, kissing that
Over under out
Over under out
You can't talk
You can't see me drowning
You can't talk
I don't see you swimming
You can't talk
You want go your way

You can't talk
You want go your way

Just the twinkling lights of heaven
Two reflections on the sparkling water
Hand in hand in love with love uhhuh
I love the cheap things that you sayasay
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
Well so do I
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright, alright, alright, alright
I'm a hurt, I'm a hurt, I'm a hurting
I'm a man with a beat in my pocket
I'm going down to the rhythm of love
I love a bad look that you bringring
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
Well so do I
Alone on a mean street
It makes me feel on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire...
On fire, on fire, on fire, on fire, on fire
I love the cheap street in your walk, uhhuh
You belong in rock 'n roll
You belong in rock 'n roll
Well so do I
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright, alright, alright, alright, alright...
Yassassin  I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin  I walk without a sound
Just a working man, no judge of men
But such a life I've never known
We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away
Look at this  no second glances
Look at this  no value of love
Look at this  just sun and steel
Look at this  then look at us
If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away
Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin
WORD ON A WING
 Album Station To Station
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced away into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again, you're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
 CD single Slow Burn
 CD single Everyone Says 'Hi' part 1
Jackson made twenty tapes in a day
To give away
A give away
And he play
The tunes they'd call creative when they're running out of names
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
But the names it hurt poor jackson stopped the haters in his way
Heaven knows he's for it
He was never quite unsure but really sane
Wants to play
Jackson stole twenty souls in a day
To take away
A take away
He takes away
And no complaints
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade
Wood jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way
Just wants to play
And how he played
The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
The words that killed Wood jackson's friends were written on the wall
Heaven knows he's for it
Just wants to play
It's a shame
It's a shame
Wants to play
It's a shame
It's a shame
Just wants to play
How you turn my world
You precious thing.
You starve and near exhaust me.
Everything I've done,
I've done for you.
I move the stars for no one.
You've run so long.
You've run so far.
Your eyes can be so cruel,
Just as I can be so cruel,
Oh I do believe in you.
Yes I do.
Live without your sunlight.
Love without your heartbeat.
Falsetto I... I...
Can't.. live.. within.. you...
Cruising around me
the flames burn my body
Does this remind them again  again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl
for the pain must feel
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such
But we lived
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you go
Hey, it ain't over
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and rolling the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, but I say it's hip
To be alive
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
that's all ya gotta do
ooh, it ain't over
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
that's all ya gotta do
ohh, it ain't over
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
thats all ya gotta do, ohh
All you've got to do is win
it ain't over
When your smile is spreading thin
seek and believe in you
Since you're trying not to lose
it ain't over, no, no
Since I'm not supposed to grin
that's all ya gotta do
All you've got to do is win
it ain't over, no,,, ohh
seek and believe in you
All you've got to do is win
it ain't over, no, no
Woohh, all you've got
Is all you've got
it ain't over
It ain't over...
Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress, satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me,
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself!
Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Solemn faced, the village settles down, undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some as the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
gives no indication for the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
pronouncing gross diversion as the label for the dog
oh it's the madness in his eyes as he breaks the night to cry
It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy from freecloud
And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crown
As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand
And the magic in the stare of the Wild Eyed Boy said
Stop, freecloud! They won't think to cut me down
But the cottages fell like the playing card hell
The tears on the face of a Wise Boy
Came trembling down to the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peacelove
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Byebye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
Turn around,go back!
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
Turn around,go back!
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
Turn around, go back!
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Everybody's raised in blindness
Everybody knows it's true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anybody's point of view
Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same
Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be real? somebody real
Hmmm, if it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see, a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you
Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Ohoh, could we, could we make a star to snatch their angels, boy
Played your role for every day
Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real? Can I be?
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell upon, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I, can I be real? Can I be real?
Can I be real? Can I be?
Who can I be?
Now Yeah, can I be now?
You found me
Now can I be free?

In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong uuuh uh uh uuuh hu
Will this depression last for long
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday uuuh uh uh uuuh hu
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys uuuh uh uh uuuh hu
And Mummy didn't need no boys
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down uuuh uh uh uuuh hu
Get your feet back on the ground
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me
When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Grown inside a plastic boxMicro thoughts and safety locksHearts become outdated clocksTicking in your mind
What's really happening? What tore us apart?
What's really happening?
What's really happening? What tore us apart?
What's really happening?
Now it's time to close our eyesNow it's time to say goodbyeNow it's time to face the lieThat we'd never cry
All the clouds are made of glassAnd they're slowly sinkingFalling like the shattered pastWere we built to last?
WHEN THE BOYS COME MARCHING HOME
 CD single Slow Burn + Everyone Says 'Hi' part 3
How to make amends for the things they said
The girls avoid the stormy sky
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, hightailing out of here
Is the lights ablazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But I and my heathen heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
"Listen to the words!" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true
When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
when the boys come marching home
home, marching home
Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But, in truth, i don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learned to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster,
Walking through the wars
The girls who never close 'til dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view  tiny, two by two
When the boys come marching home
home, marching home
home, marching home
When the boys come marching home
when the boys come marching home
Boys come marching home
home, marching home
home, when the boys come marching home
home, marching home
when the boys come marching home
When I'm five
I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather Jones
'Cause I'm only four and five is far away
When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the May Day parade
'Cause I'm only four and grownups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washingup
If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleededup my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
When I'm five
When I'm five
When I'm oah
When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice
Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream
No one can blame you for walking away
But too much protection
no love rejection.
Life can be easy
it's not always well
Don't tell me truth hurts
'cause it hurts like hell.
But down in the underground you'll find someone true
Down in the underground
a land serene and crystal.
It's only forever
not long at all
Lost and lonely  that's underground
get me out of here  ah hah
I'm underground 
Heard about a place today  nothing ever hurts again 
get me out of here  ah hah
I'm underground 
please take me down  ah hah
I'm underground 
get me out of here 
No one can blame you for walking away
But too much protection
no love rejection.
But down in the underground you'll find someone true

You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me  yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me  yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?
To be real me, to the real me
Under the cool, under the cool and under having a ball
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhh
No more delight or croning around
Whisper the word hold my hand
Nowhere forget I shall refuse you
Never forget who you've been
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And we'll read betwen the riches
And we'll dream if we don't go down
Follow the paths stay on the wrong side
Only when you is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things just like you serve you
Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear you're best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down
White boys falling on the fires of night
I wish you'd tell
I wish you'd tell
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revelation comes in the strangest way
I wish you'd tell
I wish you'd tell
I'd rather be inside you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth

We prick you we prick you we prick you
You show respect even if you disagree

Wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
I wish you well
Wanna come quick and die

We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth

We prick you we prick you we prick you
You show respect even if you disagree

You show respect
All the little rosekissed foxy girls
shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
toys, toys, little black toys
Dripping on the end of a gun
Even if you disagree
Tell the truth

We prick you we prick you we prick you

Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today
We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuckme pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right
Now I'm hoping someone will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twentyfour hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead
When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice
Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me

Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guyaVoice Here is the news
According to the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
My studies included suffragy
I formed my own society
to crush the bear of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The kroks of you, the cattle gun
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed ...
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives
You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk above your sphere?
Let me explain my project , dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives
We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream
Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore
Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday
We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word
Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday
Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
A secret love between us
Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway
Shakey threw a party
that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band
of married men
Looking up to me
 it was soso
The ladies looked bad
but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better
 it was soso
Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man!3 Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman 1fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits3were joking
the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled
with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played
the Tiger Rag3
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information
Heli venco deho
Chile venco deho
Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears,
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears,
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us.
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up in the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cos¨¬ non ritorni mai pi¨´
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass¨´
E volavo, volavo felice pi¨´ in alto del sole ed ancora pi¨´ su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggi¨´
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass¨´
Nel biu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass¨´
You got crazy legs, you got amazin' head
You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red
You got the width of my tongue name on the sun
I clutch you close to my breast
Cause you're the only one, who uses school to pleasure
You make me act real gone, you make me troll along
I had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry
Feel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own
Why if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?
Here all together
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine
You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet
So you'll give me your hand, give me your sound
Let my sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand
Oooh! Clutch your makeup!
Shoot you down, bang bang
hum Velvet Goldmine  repeat
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
A series of shocks  sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling  witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
Yea, yea, yea  up the hill backwards
It'll be alright oooooo
While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
More idols than realities oooooo
I'm OK, you're soso oooooo
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
Yea, yea, yea  up the hill backwards
It'll be alright oooooo
Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the great utopia dream
And you're in the gleam
In the depths of your banker's splean
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the reats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So now, You could spend the morning walking with me
As I am Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatos
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend your morning talking with me
Look out, I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed
Now you run from your window
To the prcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the stramge Unwashed and Happily Slightly Dazed.
In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slows
Now we're swimming luck by the river doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls
It's clear that some things never take
Please, heal these tears
She will feel like at tea, make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Oh lady, oh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up up up up oh ah
It's clear that some things never
Please, heal these tears
We steal these tears
It's clear that some things never take
It's clear that somethings never
Please heal these tears
Some things never
No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection na na
No love injection
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell
But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground

A crystal moon, ah, ah

Written by David Bowie, Queen.
Sung by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury.
Mm ba ba de
Um bum ba de
Um bu bu bum da de
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da  that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Chippin' around  kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
People on streets  ee da de da de
People on streets  ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow  gets me higher higher high
Pressure on people people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why  why  why?
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
give love give love give love give love give love
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the People on streets edge of the night
And loves People on streets dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother
Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention
to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a,
he's got more channels
oh my T V C one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my T V C one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
oh my T V C one five
Oh, so demonic,
oh my T V C one five
Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
my dream test baby,
She's my main feature"
My T V C one five, he, he just
Stares back unblinking
oh my T V C one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
My baby's in there someplace
Love's rating in the sky
oh my T V C one five
Oh my T V C one five,
oh oh, T V C one five
Oh my T V C one five,
oh oh, T V C one five
Oh my T V C one five,
oh oh, T V C one five
Oh my T V C one five,
oh oh, T V C one five
I've seen the city
I took the next flight
They say it's pretty
I like the tshirts
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
with a book on Borneo
Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto
Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
I'll tumble and twirl
They twirl and they tumble
They twirl and they tumble
I like the free world
I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
This time of year
Tumble and tumble
I like the free world
Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some, I bought some...
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you...
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
'Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh
Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high...
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
'Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushin' for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking , looking for a break
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
what I'm trying to say
You can't have a lover
It's me and no other
I'm a bad loserI'mashakin' in anger
Too Dizzyyou can't have no lover
Don't come any closer
You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'maten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'twitchin'itchin' for a break
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose.
I know a government man
he was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
he took a topgun pilot.
He made him fly through a hole till he grew real old
And he never came down
he iust flew till he burst.
Time will crawl  till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl  till our feet arow small
Time will crawl  till our tails rall ofF
Time will crawl  till the 21st century lose.
I saw a black black stream full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man with no eyes at all.
I felt a warm warm breeze that melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine that lasted three long years.
And the pills that I took made my fingers disappear.
Time will crawl
time will crawl
Time will crawl  till the 21st century lose.
You were a talented child
you came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream when your mask went an
We only smelt the gas as we lay down to sleep.
Time will crawl  and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl  and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl  and the streets run red
Time will crawl  till the 21st century lose.
Time will crawl  till our mouths run dry
. . .
Time will crawl  and our heads bowed down
. . .
Time will crawl  for the crazy child
Time will crawl  we'll give every life
Time will crawl  for the crackpot notion
Time will crawl  till the 21st century lose.
I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bare
You don't perseve so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, nonreturning
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers
I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking
Time will crawl
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon and he
He saw the sun in the night
He took a topgun pilot nad he
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old an he
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst
Time will crawl
Till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
Till our feet grow small
Time will crawl
Till our tails fall off
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel and
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years and a
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
Time will crawl

Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
Time will crawl
For the crackpot notion
Till the 21st century loose
Time will crawl
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Till the 21st century loose
Time  He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time  He flexes like a who
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time  In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
I look at my watch it say 925 and I think "Oh God I'm still alive"
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai
Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai
You  are not a victim
You  just scream with boredom
You  are not evicting time
Chimes  Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai

What to do
What to say
What to wear on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night
Reaching the very edge, you know
Reaching the very edge
Going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell
I am a drug
I am a dragon
I am the best jazz you've ever seen
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old
What is eternal?
What is damned?
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis?
Who to truss?
Who to listen to?
Who to suss?
I'm reaching the very edge, you know

Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a Job
When you know the moneys from day to day
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
Threepenny pierrot  we love you
Threepenny pierrot  loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, threepenny pierrot
Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of columbine
Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his columbine
Threepenny pierrot  we love you
Threepenny pierrot  loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, threepenny pierrot
To tap his feet to greet dear harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all
Threepenny pierrot  we love you
Threepenny pierrot  loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, threepenny pierrot
Threepenny pierrot  we love you
Threepenny pierrot  loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero . . . . . . threepenny pierrot
This is not America
Little piece of you
a little peace in me will die. @
This is not a miracle
for this is not America.
Blossom fails to bloom this season
promise not to stare too long.
This is not America
for this is not the miracle.
There was a time
a storm that blew so pure.
For this could be the biggest sky
and I could have the faintest idea.
For this is not America
This is not America
this is not
Showman melting from the inside
falcon spirals to the ground.
This could be the biggest sky
so bloody red tomorrows' clouds.
A little piece of you
a little peace in me will die.
This could be a miracle
for this is not America.
There was a time
a wind that blew so young.
For this could be the biggest sky
and I could have the faintest idea.
For this is not a miracle
This is not America
this is not
This is not America
this is not.
This is not America
this is not
Voulezvous voir un monde étrange
Où l'on aime les démons et pas les anges ?
Suiveznous, venez visiter
Notre magnifique cité.
Voici Halloween, voici Halloween,
Les citrouilles vont mourir de trouille !
C'est ça Halloween,
Tout le monde a mauvaise mine.
C'est normal ! C'est pour terroriser les citrouilles!
Minuit sonne... C'est l'heure du crime !
Bienvenue à Halloween !
Moi je me cache sous votre lit le soir.
Mes dents, mes yeux brillent dans le noir.
Moi je me cache sous votre escalier,
Doigts de serpents et cheveux d'araignées.
C'est ça Halloween, c'est ça Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween ! Halloween ! Halloween !
C'est la ville de la nuit...
Les citrouilles chantent et les chauves sourient !
On plaisante, on fait des bêtises,
On ne sait pas quelle sera la prochaine surprise !
Au coin de la rue, il y a des inconnus
Qui surgissent des poubelles pour vous faire...
... Peur !
C'est ça Halloween !
Rouge et noir...
... Gélatine !
Quelle horreur !
C'est un enfer !
Par le feu, par la glace,
Il faut jouer à pile ou face
Et s'envoler à tombeau ouvert !
C'est la ville du crime ! C'est la ville du crime !
Bienvenue à Halloween !
Je perds la tête, quelquefois je l'arrache
Avant de disparaître dans un flash.
Je suis le mort qui prend le mors aux dents...
Je suis le vent qui vous glace le sang...
Moi, je me glisse comme une ombre noire
Et je transforme vos rêves en cauchemars !
C'est ça Halloween, c'est ça Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Y'a des enfants beaucoup trop sages...
On préfère ceux qui ont la rage !
On fait peur...
... Mais on se domine,
Dans le ville d'Halloween !
On plaisante, on fait des bêtises,
Tout le monde attend la prochaine surprise !
Si Jack le squelette,
Sans tambours ni trompettes,
Surgit dans votre dos,
Vous ne ferez pas de vieux os !
C'est ça Halloween !
C'est la ville du crime,
Bienvenue à l'épouvantable épouvantail !
Bravo Jack !
T'es un crack !
Vive notre nouveau roi !
Jack la gargouille
Est le roi des citrouilles !
C'est ça Halloween, c'est ça Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
C'est la ville de la nuit...
Les citrouilles chantent et les chauves sourient !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween !
Halloween ! Halloween...
There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup
Go away, sir
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us
Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray
There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup
Go away, sir
Boo, boo, boo, boo doop ...
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life
Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life
Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life
Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I believe in magic
Angel for life
Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again
And stare the sun
Till my eyes burn
At the mothers
At the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
And I shake
Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
Is a tightening Atrocity
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell
To have seen it all
The voyeurOf utter destruction
And I shake
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again
Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex

When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless
Could heave nor sigh
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a superGod cries
Where all were minds in unithought
Powers weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sadeyed merment tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold.
Far out in the redsky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries
Far out in the redsky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies
The secret life of arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green
I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green
The secret life of arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green
The secret life of arabia
You must see the movie the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies
Arabia secret secret
Arabia secret secret
Arabia secret secret
Arabia secret secret
Arabia secret secret
Arabia secret secret
The secret life of arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green
What to wear
What to say
What to do on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a sunday night?
Reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side of this town
Reaching the very edge
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
I am a drug I am a dragon
I am your best jazz you've ever seen
I am the dragon I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I found you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old
What is eternal
What is damned
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis
Who to trust
Who to listen to?
And who to suss
I'm reaching the very edge you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side of this town
I'm reaching the very edge
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
I am a dragon I am a drug
I am your best jazz you've ever had
I am the dragon I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I found you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
You're still breathing but you just don't know why
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take the place, near you
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart, in pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star
For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can
It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And the sirens flies on their's breif flight
The razor sharp rapture affair
And we light up our life
And there's no one that beeing exploating you
Re exploating you
Like everybody do
Re exploating you
And I don't know what to use
Makes somebody blue
Me exploating me exploating you
Wash your face before your faded makeup makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never comes so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirror's hung up on you
Don't be last, your friends and your reflection
It's all so direction now
Poor harlequin, you're quite an exception
Fay troubadour, on a downer
Gay harlequin, doesn't believe in you
Doesn't believe it's true, such a downer.
We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died along, a long long time ago
Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World
Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World
Streets damp and warm
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
Steam under floor
Shards by the mirrors frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
Well I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Cow bell strikes another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Hold your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
I was walking down the High Street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man Hello
In scarlet and grey, shuffling away laughter
Well he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly Oaah..
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day laughter
Oh, I ought to report you to the Gnome office
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you can't catch me"
Said the laughing Gnome
Well I gave him roasted toadstools and a glass of dandelion wine Burp, pardon
Then I put him on a train to Eastbourne
Carried his bag and gave him a fag
Haven't you got a light boy?
"Here, where do you come from?"
Gnomeman's land, hahihihi
In the morning when I woke up
He was sitting on the edge of my bed
With his brother whose name was Fred
He'd bought him along to sing me a song
Right, let's hear it
Here, what's that clicking noise?
That's Fred, he's a "metrognome", haha
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you can't catch me"
Own up, I'm a gnome, ain't I right, haha
"Haven't you got an 'ome to go to?"
No, we're gnomads
"Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school? you look like a rolling gnome."
No, not at the London School of Ecognomics
Now they're staying up the chimney
And we're living on caviar and honey hooray!
Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows
It's theer what?
It's the Gnome service of course
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing Gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, oh, dear me

"stamford hill, four square miles of sh....."
In a west end city
In a west end city
Smells like daisies

Ain't it fucking curious some other cunts
Are trying to ditch the king
Of stamford hill

Ain't it fucking curious some other cunts

Gonna build an army
March them to the marches
Marching up and down
Watch them flap their little wings
Someone's gonna lose his poxy face
Ain't it fucking curious some other cunts
Are trying to ditch the king
Of stamford hill
Of stamford hill
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back plazas
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a gogo and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!
He's so simple minded he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!
hearts filthy lesson x3
there's always a diamond friendly
sitting in the laugh's hotel
the hearts filthy lesson

She'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old Marianne, who needs friends, oh
That's the fucking time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten Mary down the oak
Wouldn't give me two pence for him
Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky chant most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And it's stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from god's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpsechoked rivers just one more corpse
Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys
Shallow man shallow man and they
Eats in the doorways with his head inclined
And he's always in decline
Noone hears anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion skies
So it goes so it goes
Just a searcher so it goes
Lonely soul so it goes
The last of the dreamers so it goes
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day
So it goes so it goes
Just a searcher so it goes
Lonely soul so it goes
The last of the dreamers so it goes
so it goes Just a searcher
so it goes Lonely soul
so it goes The last of the dreamers so it goes
so it goes Just a searcher
so it goes Lonely soul
so it goes The last of the dreamers so it goes
so it goes
so it goes
so it goes
so it goes
And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the Goodmen Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devilmaybehere
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers
Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutchhungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the MindWarp Pavilion
Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey
Just for the Day, Hey!
Hey, Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I believe that dreams come through
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in sky
Made the world for you and I
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself
Why am I so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom
You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning
Now you has class
Now you has splash
Now you has mass motivation
Here's an image I can recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
Get you fired upp burning go oh oh
You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it
You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony
Symphony in style that's motivation
It's brilliant, original that's motivation
Stimulating, encouragement that's motivation
As precious from home that's motivation
So what motivation
Say what motivation
Now you has class motiv
Now you has mass motivation
Baby, you can own two hearts
Baby, don't try to tear me apart
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
Baby, you can't fool around
Baby, can't turn me upside down
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
It's just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
It's just a matter of time, call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
Baby, you've got me used
Baby, Can't you be like you?
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
Ad lib to end
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress
Telling lies Oh ah visionary oh ah visionary
Telling lies feels like somethings gonna happen this year
Telling lies Oh ah visionary oh ah visionary
Telling lies feels like somethings gonna happen this year
Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with teras and blame
I'm your future
I am tomorrow
I am the end
Telling lies Oh ah visionary oh ah visionary
Telling lies feels like somethings gonna happen this year
Telling lies Oh ah visionary oh ah visionary
Telling lies feels like somethings gonna happen this year
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh

Oh ah Teeelliinggg Liiieesss
Oh ah Teeelliinggg Liiieesss
Feels like somethings gonna happens this year
Oh ah Teeelliinggg Liiieesss
Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above, sun on your arms strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire  I guess the season is on
So you trade by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys
Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, ohooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall, shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
And I feel like a group of one, nono
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
'I miss you he had to go'
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, ohohohohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, ohohohohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Wild  Life

You think you're gonna please her so you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her 'Cause you're playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my oh my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip get on out
Take my tip get on out
You can't give all you got to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip get on out
Take my tip get on out
You think you're gonna please her so you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her 'Cause you're playing with the tiger who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my oh my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Get it off, take my tip
Get it off, take my tip
You can't give all you have to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on the rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip get on out
Take my tip get on out
Take my tip get on out
Take my tip get on out
If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you
It's safe in the city, to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If his trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I tried to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
I've got ninetynine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninetynine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninetynine years of murder called life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall
Sweet head, give you sweet head
spoken while ya down there
See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all
Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god
You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd
Move along, sir!
Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should of been more wiser kind of guy
I miss you
Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
There's noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you
Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time is on my side?
I got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I'll never lied to you
I hate it when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
People boys all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wished I'd sent a valentine
I loved you
Your naked eyes
My naked eyes
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Through these clouds
As on wings
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, in your fear
As on wings
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick
Just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blamblam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes
Here she comes
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
Ohhh, Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am!

Yooou, yooou, yooou
Yooou, yooou, yooou
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Hotter than the sun
No pecchy frairs
No trendy rechauffe
I'm with you
So I can't go wrong
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
For we're strangers when we meet
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
And it's a dying world
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence
Raging tears upon the sheet
For we're strangers when we meet
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Dazzled by the new
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride roughshod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
STATION TO STATION
 Album Station To Station
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, lost in my circle, dredging the ocean.
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stays
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, raise your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the sideeffects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late  to be grateful
It's too late  to be late again
It's too late  to be hateful
The european cannon is here
I must be only one in a million
Cause I can't pass a day pass without her
It's too late  to be grateful
It's too late  to be late again
It's too late  to be hateful
The european cannon is here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late  to be grateful
It's too late  to be late again
It's too late  to be hateful
The european cannon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
The european cannon is here
It's not the sideeffects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late  to be grateful
It's too late  to be late again
It's too late  to be hateful
The european cannon is here
I must be only one in a million
Cause I can't pass a day without her
It's too late  to be grateful
It's too late  to be late again
It's too late  to be hateful
The european cannon is here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late  to be grateful
It's too late  to be late again
It's too late  to be hateful
The european cannon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
The european cannon is here, yes it's here

Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain

Didn't know what time it was the lights were low oh oh

I could make it all worthwhile as a rock  roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock  roll star
So inviting  so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock  roll star
Get it all yeah!
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey  and I'd c'mon like a regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night as a rock  roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock  roll star

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five,
Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell me wife I love her very much she knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do.
Doo, doo, doo, dodoh
Doo, doo, doo, dodoh
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
Stone love  she kneels before the grave
A brave son  who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love  a boy and girl they talking
New words  that only they can share in
New words  a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep  through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing  sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none  just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love  and love is not loving
Soul love  the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love  and how my God on high is
All love  though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in its choosing  sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none  just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love  and love is not loving
Lai lai lala lala lala la lai lai
Lalai lalai lalai lai lai lai
Lala lala lala lalala la la lala la lala la la
Time is tight love always, get's in the way
Didn't mean to hurt you but I always do
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry you know I am
Well my eyes are pinned and the money's spent
Well I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry
I wouldent do for me what I would for you
I'm so sorry
I guess I've thrown it away
I thrown it away
Didn't mean to do it that way
Time is so tight and I mean it if I say
I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
You know I am
Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down sons of sound and sons of sound
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way sons of sound and sons of sound
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day
Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down sons of sound and sons of sound
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in sons of sound and sons of sound
Sons of sound and sons of sound
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!
Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more
Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone
Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So they're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity
Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
A couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes, oh here she comes
Oh, here she comes oh
Your coat and hat are gone
I've really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we've lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled to fast then can't think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return
And there's is something in the air
Something in my eye
I've dance with you too long yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo, I loose you
We can't avoid the clash
The big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you to long
Say what you will
There's something in the air
Raced for the last time
Well I know you'll hold your head up high
But it's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
Do do do do
Do do do do
I've danced with you too long
Do do do do
Do do do do
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in the air
Do do do do
Do do do do
Let the lies go
He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says "I'm somebody"
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there somebody likes me"
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use
Somebody He's so divine Oh oh his soul shines
Somebody Breaks the night, sleep tight
Somebody up there, somebody
His ever loving face Oh oh smiles on the whole human race Somebody somebody somebody up there

Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen what they look like
Where they've been
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says "Don't hurry, baby don't hurry baby
Somebody up there somebody please go Oh oh
And who are the people
That given time, please go Somebody somebody
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell Oh oh
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?

Sailors in snow
Send a callout raising hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ah
Sailors in snow
Send a callout rasing hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ah
Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in the dark
And they'll play with our lives
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
But who are we
So small in times such as these
Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Though the years snare them all
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round and upside down
There's fear overhead
There's fear overground
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
And here are we
At the center of it all
Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away
Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world in war torn
How I wonder where you are
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world inwar torn
How I wonder where you are
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Here's the town in which I live petunia green
Here's the shop and here's the man who sold me laces for my shoes
There is mr.marcus. boys they say he's mad
?here's the battle that they won? silver treetop school for boys
Early days were good as gold
An apple here an apple there
And everywhere a ?yes sir?, ?no sir?
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day
I've never been so happy than at silver treetop school for boys
The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
That when the ? ? ? had risen to the pipe of mr.marcus
The smell of teaching fell upon the cricket field
Smiling, laughing, rolling about at silver treetop school for boys.
They call in the staff room
They call in the canteen
"hey come and look at what I found"
"i found some boys and masters sitting
On the cricket ground at silver treetop school for boys"
The english master, sir, he wores a purple mask
And the head, was usually sad, was swinging from a tree
Mr.brown the physics man is off his head
And everyone just loves the grass at silver treetop school for boys
Lalalalalalala lalala lalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalalala
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die
La la la la la , la la , la la la la
La la la la la , la la , la la la la
La la la , la la
La la la , la la
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly Boy Blue , blue
Silly Boy Blue
Silly Boy Blue
Silly Boy Blue
Between the dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking ?bout his family and the cold back home
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
?tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume of a michael jackson song
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
?tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
"that's a mighty big word for a nine year old"
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
The dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
Shopping for girls, shopping for girls
Gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
Wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll
Eddie boy lit like paraffin
spending two weeks
in a crack house
Burns on his brain
Dean was seen
with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for
till I met you
Life is like a broken arrow
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy
every day of your life
Making my love
like a shining star
takin' my love just a touch too far
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice,
I've touched down with vermin,
And I say
Nobody cares what you do
please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.
Making my love
like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far.
Peter met Frank
formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn
Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page
with debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave
Life is like a broken arrow
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well I could make you happy
every goddamn single day of your life
Making my love
like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby that's what you are
Like a shining star
Making my love
like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
She's got medals
Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
She's got medals
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down
She's got medals
She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along riverside
She slips beneath the sheets
A husbands quiet devoted wife
But strangers sad and nervous
By the dawns early light
Loves lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on riverside
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson yea
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea
And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
Way back when Millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dreamlife
He'd take her back to streetlife
Away from violent water
With its Cormorants and leaves
Up on riverside
She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit faster now
We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook my cold
I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told
I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her sooo
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same
Come tomorrow, will I be older
Come tomorrow, maybe a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today
Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these land
Don't make them desert sands
Come tomorrow, will I be older
Come tomorrow, maybe a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today
Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind
I feel like a sailboat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me
I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
And I wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well
Duck and I sway  what's my line
Shoot at a full moon  what's my line
So what's my line  shake it baby
Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
Shake it baby
Ah shake it shake it
I duck and I sway  what's my line
I shoot at a full moon  what's my line
So what's my line  shake it shake it baby
Shake shake it
Shake it baby
Shake shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it shake it
There's a man back aways
Who believes at where he is
And there's a girl
Up ahead who says she knows
And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the guy who can't be seen
He's the shadow man
And the shadow man is close at hand
Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the shadow man
You can call him joe, you can call him sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
But the shadow man is really you
Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrows
Of what you did today
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the shadow man is waiting round the bend
Oh, the shadow man
Shadow man, shadow man
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you
He's the shadow man
Though the idea of compassion
Is said to be
The union of Christ
And his bride, the Christian
It's all very puzzling
Sex and the church

Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we layed on your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how he wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die
The Gods forgot they made me
So I forgot them to
I listen to their shadows
I play among their graves
My heart is never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life or saven ways to die
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold
See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of a summer day
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold
La la la la la la
I was Ramona A Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artist
In the tunnel
But I remarring a midilife crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've put my heart's in
And I paint the pretty colours Enghlish
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who this warfriend is like
Old Touchschriek was the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling interest drugs
She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was if you don't mine me saying so an update demon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage
With a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
Woa! "Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began
My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here
still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone
or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh, I dream of something like that
Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me
Screaming like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of socsociety
Soc socie s
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
No athletic program, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
She had an horror of rooms
she was tired
you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer
if she didn't walk the way she do,
and she do
She opened strange doors
that we'd never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She asked me to stay
and I stole her room
She asked for my love
and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl
and I'll love her till the day she dies
Jimmy's guitar sound
Waiting at the light know what I mean
 Album Scary Monsters
She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat

Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine
They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food,
How they adored till it cried in its boredom,
'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now,
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all.
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay.
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine
I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine.

I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twentythree down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it
I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians
I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues
I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues

There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
In the '14'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
Oh yeah... I hope you break your baton
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin
Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
It's so hard to say goodnight
It's you that I love now can't you see?
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, oohyeah, ah
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The walltowall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clocks waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suciide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
They're so natural  religiously unkind
Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful
Oh gimme your hands.
You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!
Right on mother you've really blow my mind
I never thought we'd hit it off until today
Right on mother you know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real
I never thought you dig it so sure you hit the roof
And now you telling me you understand
That I'm a man
Ba ba ba ba

Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet  ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet  ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet  it's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet  ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet  ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers  march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet it's not the end of the world
That's when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten
Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the chevy's real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her
"Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?"
Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
It was a day in that blue month september
Silent beneath the plum trees? slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air
Feel a bit roughed up, feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around
Red sails take me, make me sail along
Red sails, and a mast so tall
Do you remember we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall kept us all in tune
Bringing us all back home
Sailor can't dance like you, ooh, yooou
Ahh, red sail
Red sail action
Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along
Life stands still and stares
The hinterland, the hinterland
We're gonna sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da
Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?
Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along
Can you hear it fall
Can you hear it well
Can you hear it at all
I was really feeling good
Reet Petite and how d'ya do
Then I got the small red box
And I didn't know what to do
'Cause my fingers could not grope
And I could not give it away
And I knew I must not drop it
Stop it, take it away
Can you hear it fall
Can you hear it well
Can you hear it at all
Can you hear it fall
Can you hear it well
Can you hear it at all
Can you hear it at all
Can you hear it at all
It's up to you and me
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo 3 times
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
You've got your mother in a whirl 'cause she's
Not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo 2 times
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know
Calamity's child, chichile, chichile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me
And I swear
Yes I swear
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Yes I swear
I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality
Ha ha ha ha
I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Huh ha ha
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise?
As I walk down the aisle
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a midlife crisis
And I've been dreaming in a sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say twitch  stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female
good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am Ramona A Stone
Give it to me one more time! 7
La mia mente ha presol il volo
Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la citta?
I soui occhi mella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sara??
Dimmi ragazzo solo dove uai,
Perche? tanto dolore?
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amorie e'tutta peina la citta,
No ragazza sola, no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei.
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero? mai piu
Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte e'un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie na stasera io vorrei morire
Perche? sai negli occhi miei
C'e? un angelo, un angelo
Che ormai non vola piu? che ormai non vola piu?
Che ormai non vola piu?
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero? mai piu?
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power, anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Duh pu thu ku kun ba pa ta da da
I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's try hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind
Oh not her
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bippertybopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
She's an oldtime ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can't do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen, and such a queen
Such a laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bippertybopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, Why didn't I say, no, no, no
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bippertybopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
To tat yah
She's just been to russia and they're dying their faces
They're dying over there
A pretty pink rose
That r'n?r lady takes a spaceship ride she's out of this world
A pretty pink rose
And we're living for you my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you my love
Pretty pink rose
She tore down paris on the tall of thom paine
But the left wings broken the right insane
A pretty pink rose
Have a nice day, it's a killer, turn a cheek
It's a christian code
A pretty pink rose
And we're living for you my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you my love
Pretty pink rose
She's the poor mans gold she's the anarchist crucible
Flying in the face of the despot cannible
She's a pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never let it rain on the heart of the pretty pink rose
Pretty pink rose
And we're living for you my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you my love, pretty pink rose
Get me thru the pain, thru the pain of the thorn on the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain never rain, the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart,, of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart

In the port of amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light
In the port of amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps
In the port of amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of amsterdam
In the port of amsterdam
There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
Ahchoo ! excuse me
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
God, it's pouring down
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day , st ....ah choo !
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
MaryAnn was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes myself
And this one here's for you
Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain
Nothing on smoke today
Nothing dies on the wing
Wing's been losing time
An anarchy born in pain
Pain that comes and goes
It goes against all you see
You see I got gables eyes
And eisenhower blames the poor
The poor huddled on the curb
Gotta get back in shape
We're backing up a major plan
We're treading on ? ? ? ? lights
We're walking under golden sun
We're living in a planet of dreams
We're living in a planet of dreams
We're living in a planet of dreams
We're living in a planet of dreams
We're living in a planet of dreams
We're living in a planet
5 more times
Do do do do
People from bad homes
Don't have the time
To look things over
Make up their minds
People from good homes
Dn't have the minds
To care for bad homes
Don't have the time
Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
Me I got no home
Just main street and wine
No one to hussle no one to jive
Me and my prospects just having a ball
Having the best time but nothing at all
Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love

Peace on earth, can it be
Years from now, perhaps we'll see
See the day of glory
See the day, when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again
Peace on earth, can it be
Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can
I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again
Peace on earth, can it be
Can it be
Bing it's a pretty theme, isn't it?
He looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion.
Such a humble man
The only survivor
Of the national people's gang.
Panic in Detroit. I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home. I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit.
He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers
Were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit. I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home. I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
An' found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
An' jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights.
Having scored a trillion dollars,
Made a run back home.
Found him slumped across the table.
A fun and me alone.
I ran to the window.
Looked for a plane or two.
Panic in Detroit. He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust". I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Well some people try to pick up girls
They get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
The girls would turn the colour of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
He could walk down your street
Girls could not resist his stare
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Not like you
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Well the girls would turn the colour of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
Well he was only 5'3"
But girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not in New York
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his picture nails
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"
I know all the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cause he remembered that he was a screw
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"
My name is Henry though some say I'm thick
I've spent half me life in and out of the nick
My mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
Now I sussed all them files I'm a clever young man
Now I look stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go

"Double 3, 425" "Hi"
"Double 3, 426, Double 3, 426, where is he?"
"Here, keep it up the ledge another course and we're out"
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"
My name is Regie the scandolous mind
I got seven years so I gossip my time
I gave all the tickbits and pieces of newt
I'm a privilidged corpse and my uniform is blue
The new lads would ask me if I am a screw
I'll tell them oh cheeky not even for you
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go

"He went out for a cup of tea at the local football match sir"
"Oh.... well he might have invited me"
Over the wall we go

Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screws are in tears
We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost
Just past the Kensington Yards at the most
Our limbs was aching, we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty, our hallows did droop
We crawled back to safety, our hearts filled with gloom
Cause we'd dug ourselves through to the smallest room
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note wishing "Happy New Year"
"Hello, who is it?"
"Double 3, 429, guv"
"Oh, hang on a minute...
Hello sonny Jim
Been wondering where you were
Did you have a nice Christmas?"
Now. Not tomorrow
It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you
Now. Not tomorrow
It's happening now
It's happening now
The crazed in the hotzone
The mental and divas hands
The fisting of life
Till The music outside
Till The music outside
It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening, now
It's happening now
I want you now
I want you today
I need you now
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
The music is outside
The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fire
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away heyhey
Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive  no conversation
Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
On thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away
One thing nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
On thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away
The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away
Look out on a dream world
Windows and wifes
No bedroom to run too
No woman that i
Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a spitfire
One shot put her away
One shot put her away hey hey
One shot put her away
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah ha haaaa
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
One shot put her away
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes,
shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky
and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're
here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me,
no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found
by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though
they're here to stay
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way
for the Homo Superior
Look at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Nothing to be desired
It leaves nothing to be desired
There's nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired any more
Change your mind changing
And there's nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired
Certainly not ?
Nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired
It's not mind changing
Change your mind changing
Change your mind changing
Change your mind changing
Change your mind changing
Change your mind change
Nothing to be desired appeared on
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy
Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows
But nobody calls
Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera
But nobody phones
Not at all x3
At all     x4
Not at all x2 
Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged  no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged  no control
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
Forbidden words, deafen me
In memoriy, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't beleieve i've no control
It's all derenged
I can't beleieve i've no control
It's all derenged
 Album Black Tie White Noise
There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns it's face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dog dug up fine dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The wrong lick fist you choke has hit the blood light
Glass traps opened and close on nite flights
Broken necks, feather plates pressed and warped
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall
Glass traps opened and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather ways press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to call
On nite flights
On nite flights
Only one way to fall
On nite flights
On nite flights
On nite flights
Only one way to fall
Ah ah ah ah ah
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
Nightclubbing real nightclubbing
Or isn't it wild
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dancers brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Or isn't it wild
Do you see that thing
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of night
The clouds are stuck like candyfloss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo
My, oh my, it's a tomtom beat
Noone knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the GoGo Boys
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
And I don't mean to wait too long
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo
Pretty as a picture
New York's in love
New York's in love
New York's in flames
See the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in colour
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go

Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
Got your mother in a whirl 2nd time 'cause
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hairs alright
Hey, babe, lets go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing, and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more, and you want it first
Put you down, say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doodoo doo doo doo doo
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got transmission and a live wire
Got your cue lines and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dues
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
To what you wanna know
Calamitys child, chichile, chichile
Where'd you wanna go?
Can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
How could they know? Hah
Better take care
Think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown 321
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now
And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
Wanna be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever gonna get old
Down where your paint is cracking
Look down you backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash
You can't help him
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you

Old Touchschriek was
the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling
She got males all hung up
on her mind filters
She was if you don't mind me saying so an update demon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage
With a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero
in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
Woa! "Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to
when it all began
My death waits like an old roue'
so confident, I'll go his way
whistle to him
and the passing time...
my death waits like a bible truth
at the funeral of my youth
we drank for that 
the passing time..
my death waits like
a witch at night
as surely as our love is right
let's not think of that or the passing time
But whatever lies behind the door
there is nothing much to do...
angel or devil, I don't care
for in front of that door...
there is you.
My death waits like a beggar blind
who sees the world through an unlit mind
throw him a dime
for the passing time...
my death waits to allow my friends
a few good times
before it ends
let's not think about
and the passing time..
my death waits there, between your thighs,
your cool fingers will close my eyes,
let's not think about the passing time.
For whatever lies behind the door
there is nothing much to do...
angel or devil, I don't care
for in front of that door...
there is you.
My death waits there among the leaves
in magician's mysterious sleeves,
rabbits and dogs, and the passing time...
my death waits there, among the flowers
where the blackest shadows cowers
so let's pick lilacs
the passing time..
my death waits there, in a double bed
sails of oblivion and my head
let's not think about
the passing time.
But whatever lies behind the door
there is nothing much to do...
angel or devil, I don't care
for, in front of that door...
there is you.
Sometimes I feel
The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on
Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild
Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that
Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you
Can't forget you
Can't forget you
Come on strong, girl
Oh, lay your heavy trip on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
Oh, right on!
Come on, you mothers!
Keep your mouth shut
And listen to the word inside
Keep your head on
And open up your eyes real wide
Keep the change, love
Let me fix it for you inside
There isn't any room to hide
Take it all, take it all
I'm an alligator, I'm a mamapapa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a big monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Freak out, far out, in out
I don't want to go out
I wont stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave byebye
But I try, I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave byebye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
Modern love  walks beside me
Modern love  walks on by
Modern love  gets me to the church on time
Church on time  terrifies me
Church on time  makes me party
Church on time  puts my trust in god and man
God and man  no confessions
God and man  no religion
God and man  don't believe in modern love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
Modern love  walks beside me
Modern love  walks on by
Modern love  gets me to the church on time
Church on time  terrifies me

 Album Black Tie White Noise
Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spins around my little room, miracle goodnight
Even flower all alone, pazanane capeche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing miracle goodnight
Breath tell me turn it around
Heart tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
I wish there was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing miracle goodnight
Breath tell me turn it around
Heart tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that
The less we know, the better we feel
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing miracle goodnight
Breath tell me turn it around
Heart tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
Skin tell me turn it around
Moon tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
Eyes tell me
Judes tell me nobody dancing
Nobody dancing miracle
Skin tell me tonight
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing nobody dancing
Breath tell me turn it around
Heart tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
Skin tell me turn it around
Maybe I should announce it, should I
Memory of a free festival
The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, ha ha ha

The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, yeah yeah
The Sun Machine is coming down, woh ho ho

Check ignition and may God's love be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
?This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows?
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
?Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do.?
This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time
This boy is made of envy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs
You remind me of the babe.
The babe with the power.
The Power of voodoo.
Remind me of the babe.

LUCY CAN'T DANCE
 Album Black Tie White Noise
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Oh oh oh
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
There's tooling your frenzy in the Tole Savoy
And the sexual noise which is caught up a toy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance
Lucy can't dance
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in the stirial ? world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Of the show of the fine reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and to die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Lucy can't dance
Lucy can't dance

"Loving the Alien"
Album "Tonight" '84
Watching them come and go
The templars and the saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams oh ho
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of coeur de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
Believing the strangest things, loving the alien
And your prayers they break the sky in two
Believing the strangest things, loving the alien
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays oh ho
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear oh ho
Prayers they hide the saddest view
Believing the strangest things, loving the alien
And your prayers they break the sky in two
Believing the strangest things, loving the alien
You pray till the break of dawn
Believing the strangest things, loving the alien
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
Believing the strangest things, loving the alien
Believeing the strangest things loving the alien
And as the sparrow sings
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life,
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry...dry
Hey hey hey bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
Left high and dry
And as the sun rise stream
She finds lavender
To fight the beckoning
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout
Ohh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Ohh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's neverending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum

Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry
Ohh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday
The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
Noone can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn

"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
Till you come
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
Till you come
Waiting so long, ahhh...
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so repeat ad inf.

Once upon a time there was a toy soldier and he lived in the play room
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his hand
And every night little girl sadie would take all her clothes off and wind up the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she locked her door so she could play
Little sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockworks so to tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
One day sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Til suddenly the little toy soldier spring, went. . .
ugly, beat her to death
Cough, cough, cough
War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the icecream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said  no more
To the little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
Frightening, frightening, frightening
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
I've got Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
It's Frightening, frightening, frightening
It's a godawful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on Amerikas tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's a God awful small affair
To the girl with the mousey hair,
But her mummy is yelling,  No!
And her daddy has told her to go,
But her friend is nowhere to be seen.
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seats with the clearest view
And she's hooked on a silver screen,
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more.
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Fighting in the dance hall.
Look at those cavemen go.
It's the freaky show.
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy.
Wonder if he'll ever know

Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow.
And the workers have struck for fame

From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads.
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns,

Life is a circus
It's not fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair
Friends come to see me
To see the show
When will they realize
The circus must go
Papa he talks to me
Don't try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?
Stand straight and true
Christ don't tell
Translation by mia berg.
Schan aus deinen fenster, schau wer draussen sitzt
Ich bin ? hier wartet schon die ganze nacht
Wenn du dann dein haus verlaesst winke ich und ruft
Ah ha, wunder schoenes maedchen
Mein brennend verlangen er wartet am montag
Gib mir dein herz und lieb mich bis dienstag
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Ohh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on sunday
My passion's neverending and I'll love you till tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry
Ohh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till tuesday
Lieb, lieb, lieb, lieb, lieb mich bis dienstag
Lieb, lieb, lieb, lieb, lieb mich bis dienstag
Da da da dum

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you
Du du duuu, dududu dododo do do doaoaoaaaa
Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around and around and a
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guide baby
I'm just deciding baby
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, heh
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh mymymy mymy
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Let's make love
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, now

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from your shoulder
Because the years of  threading daisies lie behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Let me sleep beside you
I don't want knowledge,
I want certainty
In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun
With the sound, with the sound,
with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Earthlings on fire
With the sound, with the sound,
with the sound of the ground
Sure I get a little bit afraid
Earthlings on fire
I don't want knowledge,
I want certainty
In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"
Earthlings on fire
Oh I get a little bit afraid
I don't want knowledge,
I want certainty
Oh I get a little bit afraid
I don't want knowledge,
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Sure I get a little bit afraid
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
What a morning
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground

Earthlings on fire
Oh I get a little bit afraid

Earthlings I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
On the street
A man shouts out loud
A wallet drops
And money flies into the midday
With this sound
With this sound
With this sound mark the ground
Sure I get a little afraid 
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
In a room a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs

Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Wierd and Gilly,
The Spiders from Mars.
He played it left hand, but made it too far,
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's Band.
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'me to hang
Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.
So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands ?
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass, he was the naz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.
Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the rnan I had to break up the band
She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odour
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too
Will you stay in my Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching
Other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay
I don't want to lose the good thing that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love is better than any love other I've know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood
It's no secret, but that woman fills my lovin? cup
She sees, so ready, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Better, yes, better
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood yes, I better
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood oh, knock on wood
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood you know I would, would
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood it's no secret
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood no, oh, better
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood hangin? above me
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood I can't leave her
yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood oh no, baby
Knock on wood, woo!
Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day
Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay
Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night
Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die
I won't be breaking no rocks
I said I wont be breaking no rocks
I won't be breaking no rocks Ohohoh
I won't be breaking no rocks Ohohoh
I won't be breaking no rocks
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an icecream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting crosslegged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man
Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before
Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man
When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire
he has no brain
he has no mood
he was born again
look at him climb
They say 'Jump'
They say 'Jump'
he has two gods
he has no fear
They say he has no eyes
he has no mouth
They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'
They say 'Jump'
They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'
Got to believe somebody
They say 'Jump'
Got to believe somebody
They say 'Jump'
Got to believe
They say 'Jump'
Got to believe somebody
Got to believe
Got to believe somebody
Got to believe
Got to believe somebody
They say 'Jump'
So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World
Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Starryeyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen, color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me away
It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Real Cool World
And I know
Like a mirror, sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling ?neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above
What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories
I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes it's plan
Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away
Pretend for me
Even only for a while
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories
All the days of your life
I'm lost over you
Passion always ends this way
End this way
Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang
Well, Annie's pretty neat, she always eats her meat
Joe is awful strong, bet your life he's putting us on
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving
I'm moving, touch me!
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Oh shadow love was quick and clean, life's a well thumbed machine
I saw you watching from the stairs, you're everyone that ever cared
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving
I'm moving, touch me!
Dancing, won't someone dance with me?
Touch me!  Ohhh!
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep
You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight
You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"
Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"
You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
I guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
And you'll get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wander
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To collocate my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glid along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
Ah Janine yeah
Janine Janine Janine
Shiruetto ya kage ga

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven

I am bored from the event
I really don't understand the situation
But it's no game
Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

Shinbun wa kaki tateru
There's always tomorrow when people have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists  it's so degrading
And it's no game
I had skin like leather and the diamondhard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun, an' dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet
Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I can hear its' heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out "Penny, nickels for your pity"
Them gasoline boys downtown, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned downtown at the Beggars' Bash
I was a pimps main prophet, I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lo..ose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama
Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, an'
Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat
And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat, and It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor bo..oy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balancin', hold on by just a thread
Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat
When you get up to get out at your next stop, but they push you right down in your seat
And your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're out of that hole!, back on the street
And them southside sisters, they sure look pretty
And the cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"
And them downtown boys, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the c..c..city
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places we have
Where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look over the town
Then you think about all of the strange things
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy with all that's going down
All the people have got their problems
That ain't no bad news
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it takes you right up
And sometimes down again
Keep me satisfied
I got the love of a hootchycootchy woman
She's acallin' from inside
She's acallin' from inside
She's talkin' to you, too
What the woman really wants
You can give her somethin' too
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's acalling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
Oh yeah, all day, all the way
If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
"where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
It's too easy to say
But the service just a game a gameameameame
I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score
Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love could feel you with devotion
Was she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing come to me
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life
Was she ever
Was she ever here
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away oh ho
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away oh ho
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away oh ho
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away oh ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how could it be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again
Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yessir man for anything
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return No return
Deranged my love
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby
And the rain sets in
It's the angelman
Cruise me cruise me cruise me baby
The clutch of live and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
And the rain sets in
It's the angelman
And the rain sets in
It's the angelman
Cruise me cruise me cruise me baby
And the rain sets in
It's the angelman

I saw him by the dj
The way he danced was cool
They said I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before you
And all your friends can see
You roasting like a turkey
It's just this flame in me
And no one can burn like me
I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong
I dreamed how much I'd lay on you
Sitting by your side
Driving in my Dusenburgh
Going for a ride
I'm going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You know I switch the heat on
When you feel my golden shower
And no one can burn like me
I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong
I know what the boys call me
They think I'm Black Barbarella
But only one beam do I have
And that's this heartbeat of mine
I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong
You can go where you may
But I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there
You can stray out of sight
'Cause I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there
See you strong in the failing light
Just as strong, late at night
You can't lose my trail on you
Just you try, just you try
See me now, lost me now
But I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there
See you strong in the failing light
Just as strong late at night
You can't lose my trail on you
Just you try, just you try
You can go where you may
I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there
Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent path
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave
I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footsteps in the sand
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
I would be your slave
I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footsteps in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave
Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving won't do me no good
Hugging and akissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do?
Turning on me and some other men too
Come back baby give me one more chance
You know I still love you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance all night long
In my arms, oh yeah
Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving won't do me no good

A big fat car a diamond ring

Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no

Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream
I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the Moon
For just one time
Will you hold hands
With me under the moonlight
Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took, I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
What did I do
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And thought about you
I took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream
I took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the moon
For just one time
Will you hold hands
With me in the moonlight
I took a trip
in a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue
Well, I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
Yes what did I do
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
Thought about you
Let's say goodbye till tomorrow
With a word sincere
How do you make it through the night
I hope to God you're still here
I pray ole
Can you make, can you make it through
Can you make, can you make it through, can you make it through
Can you make, can you make it through

It's a God eat God world

And the song and wind
Brings nothing but sorrow
Oh ho oh ho, oh ho oh ho, oh ho oh ho
Can you make, can you make it through
Can you make, can you make it through, can you make it through
Can you make, can you make it through
Can you make, can you make it through, can you make it

You know I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
She'll break your heart one day
Then she'll laugh if she walks away
Yeah, I pity the fool
Well, look at the people
Guess you wonder what to do
They're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Ah, look at the people

My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday to you
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday to you
Wait, don't lose faith
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stuborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
Keep forgetting you don't love me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
Keep forgetting you don't love me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me
But I have not been to Oxford Town
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
And the prison priests it's a decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here
But I have not been to Oxford Town
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the 20th century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
But I have not been to Oxford Town
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the 20th century dies
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
20th century dies
Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street
there's no one there
the pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
my eyes can't see
but my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I've got the village I love  dig everything
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything  dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything  dig everything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing  dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything  dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
everything dig everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything  dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything  dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
I've got more friends than I had out for dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
I've made myself at home dig everything
I've made good friends which the timecheck girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows  dig everything
I sunbathe for love  dig everything
Even when it's not too hot  dig everything
'Cause I dig everything dig everything
New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby
I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I can't explain, no, I can't explain
You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a midlife crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep togeher you and I
For I know who the small friends are
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say twitch  stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am Ramona A Stone
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life
Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need
It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game
Cry, miss peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
Cry, cry, miss peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more
Cry, cry, miss peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
La la la la la
Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be liehighhighhigh
Highhigh lielow lie
Slowly, it's good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Lifetime, give me back my lifetime
I don't want to be an angel, just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me
Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a liehighhighhigh
Highhigh my oh my
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me
You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while you look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again

She's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funkythigh collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams
So come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Come on, come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We can't dance, don't talk much, just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on vaseline
The bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the spiders from Mars
Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass
Waiting for something
Looking for someone
Is there no reason?
Have I stared too long?
You say you'll leave me
And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die
Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass
Waiting for something
Looking for someone
Is there no reason?
Have I stared too long?
You say you'll leave me
And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die
Never had a good thing going
And, you know, never had a thing on
My baby got out last Monday
And me, I'm on a radio show
So come on
We really got a good thing going
Well Come on
Well Come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourse..el..elf

Mention her hammerhead
Oh, oh, ooh

Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five,
Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
"Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do."

Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh lord

Come get up my baby
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop

I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows
What I'd be without you...

I've seen so many smiling faces today
But just what lies behind them I can't see
I've lived my life in many places it seems
Now I just don't know where I want to be
Cause home ain't home anymore
My heart ain't here anymore
The years have opened up a canyon it seems
A canyon deep and wide that I can't cross
And though my nomad days have opened my eyes
I learned that every game must have a lost
Cause home ain't home anymore
My heart ain't here anymore
Don't be afraid to tell me that things are not the same
I'm older now and wiser
I know how things can change
Cause home ain't home anymore
My heart ain't here anymore
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Up until one century ago there lived,
in the Zi Duang provence of eastern country.
A glasslike spider.
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web in weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains.
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers, like floors in a buuilding.
At the top of this palacelike place, assembled with almost apparent care, were tiny shining objects, glass, beads, dewdrops.
One could almost call it an altar.
When the breeze blew thru this construction,
it produced sounds of wailing, crying.
Tiny wails, tiny cries.
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies would survive somehow on their own.
OhThe Glass Spider had blue eyes almost likea human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.
Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now
Take care, take care.
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, my fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting at the dawn, come along before the animals awake
Run moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me
All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you
Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go I see your name
I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go it's just the same
And I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes I'm glad I've got nobody
Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
And I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me
All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you
Well I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go I see your name
Well I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go it's just the same
And I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Really glad I've got nobody, oh
They come and they go
Come and they go
Brushing my cheek
Like the tears on my face
They come and they go
They vanish at dawn
Suspended in time
Vanish like tears in the rain
They take their loves away
Living so far away
Pretending to break down and cry
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
I never knew
How lonely I could feel
They come and they go
They come and they go
Brushing my cheek
Like the tears on my face
They take their loves away
Living so far away
Pretending to break down and cry
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
I never knew
How lonely I could feel
Oh pity us here we angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick hanging by thread
You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town
I guess I should, I feel I should
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?
Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel I should, I guess I should
The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life
And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of LoveMe Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now
The Year of the Diamond Dogs
Monday morning feels so bad Friday's gone

 Album Reality
 Lyrics and music by David Bowie
The televisions on and I'm walking throught the yard
How's this life that sweet when I'm crying in the car
Dying for the weekend
The kids are alright but they don't smell much
The sellup in the garage in the decks and the stuff
Dying for the weekend
The boys on a charge but his mother doesn't know
I never got around yet I tell it my soul
But we only make it crazy
We'll I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head
But I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly
The televisions on and I'm walking throught the yard
How's this life that sweet when I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend
The kids are gonna get it in an all right way
Looking pretty though but I still want to say
Do you really have to go?
Down in the backstreet the skinny get cries
Bad judge saturday another life line
Dying for the weekend
We'll I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head
But I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly
When I can fly and fall to all the end and I can fly
I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head
I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly
Pushing thru the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fatskinny people, and all the tallshort people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't apulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an icecream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think
you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk

There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Listen to me  don't listen to me
Talk to me  don't talk to me
Dance with me  don't dance with me, no
There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion

You shout it while you're dancing on the ole dance
Oh bop, fashion
Fashion! Turn to the left

In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
to shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, a loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
But any sudden movement and I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Two young? men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh let me dance dance dance
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to, crime
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame
What's your name?
Feeling so gay, feeling gay
Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I win anyway
Just a dog
I'm God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil on my hands
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog
There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog
These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

I'm walking down the middle of the road
Close my eyes pretend I'm going home
The trees surround my mind like your perfume...
Your voice is in the wind that blows
I see your name on stony ground
I look around and everything is you.
Buh  duh  buh  duh  buh

Wake up each morning rise up from my bed
A little piece of leather ?round my head
To stop the sweat from dripping on my eye...
Your grace is in the tree I see
Your strength is in the axe I wield
I look around and everything is you
Buh  duh  buh  duh  buh

Gets in my way
But I've got to stay
I've got to earn some money
make your dreams come true
I look around and everything is you.

The night's are cold, your memories keep me warm
Just the thought of you can keep me working on
Showed your picture to the guys in my gang...
Whilst sitting ?round an open fire
My memories grow warm and strong
I look around and everything is you
Buh  duh  buh  duh  buh

Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh so quietly, they say
Should've took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame, something cheap
Everyone says hi
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing to say
I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good and it's not too hot
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi
If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always call home
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do, we could do it
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says hi
And your mum and dad
Everyone says hi
And your big fat dog
Everyone says hi
There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"how are you today? "
"will you make us laugh? chase our blues away? "
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "oh, go away. who wants to play? "
"it's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
Mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drivein Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
Who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Which once had raised a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drivein Saturday
It's a Drivein Saturday repeat
Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
I went this morning to the cemetary
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down
No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down
DON'T LET ME DOWN AND DOWN
 Album Black Tie White Noise
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balence of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Still I keep my love for you
You made a date with destiny
You jogjog in my memory
You haunt in mind no fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Still I keep my love for you
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down
Don't don't let me down
Don't let me down
Nowhere to hide
No place to go
Still I keep my love for you
Still I keep my love for you
Oh there's no place to hide
No where to go
Hm hm hm
Hm hm hm
I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Huh huh huh huh I need a lover 'cause someone new
And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Don't Be Afraid
I said, don't be afraid to ray what you need
Don't be afraid
what you feel about me
Oh oh oh darling
Count me lucky I don't follow you
Don't be afraid of me feeling so blue
I said, don't be afraid to ray what you need
Don't be afraid
what you feel about me
Oh oh oh darling
Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Don't Be Afraid
I said, don't be afraid to ray what you need
Don't be afraid
what you feel about me
Oh oh oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Oh oh oh darling
Someday they won't let you, but now you must agree
The times they are atelling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasn't there
Beware the savage jaw
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we rolled
In 1984 who could ask for more
1984 who could ask for more
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
She's doesn't recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Will you sleep in fear tonight?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me didn't hear it from me
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984, who could ask for more
1984, who could ask for mororororore
1984 who could ask for more
1984 who could ask for more
1984 who could ask for more
Two by two, they go walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
Lonely nights, I dream you're there
Morning sun and you're gone
Do anything you say, do anything
One desire I ask of you
Please be mine, please be mine
Thousand years and I'll return
You'll be mine, you'll be mine
Do anything you say, do anything
Two by two they're walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
Do anything you say, do anything
Do anything you say, do anything you say
If a womans hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
For that's my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth, her lap together
For that's my way
If a woman goes on loving
When I feel to tired to play
I'd smile and go off waving, I'm leaving
For that's my way
Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?
spoken This ain't rock'n'roll.  This is genocide!
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come?
I'll keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized
Ooooooh, call them the Diamond Dogs x2
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow
Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs x2
Bowwow, woof woof, bowwow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Beware of the Diamond Dogs repeat
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise?
As I walk down the aisle
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance, dance, dance
And I'm gone, gone, gone
Let me dance, dance, dance
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
"good god" or "my" I cry and die and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to god
I couldn't cope
Or'd hope eloped
A dope she roped
This salty lie
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who
No matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
In redeyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
 Album Never Let Me Down
 Lyrics and music by David Bowie
DayIn Oo Oo
DayOut Oo Oo Oo
She was born in a handbag
love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money hone
try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
DayIn Oo Oo
DayOut Oo Oo Oo
First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
some things they turn out right
When you're under the US
someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
stealing for that one good rush
Day In Oo oo
Day Out Oo oo
She could use a little money
she's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
she's got no money, honey
she's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
late night, big town, police, shake down
She's got a ticket to nowhere
she's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
she's in the pocket of a home boy
Oh she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
she's an angry gal
There is angels everywhere
Certainty shoting her down
Shootin her with videodrugsbullets and
Angels in a ton of sound
You stay in
You fade out
You fade out
When people call us revolutionary
They're just tryin' to see
All that we choose
When all we want is everybody free
It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve
It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
We're all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sun
If loving freedom makes me quality
Of opportunity is where revolutionary
Constantly, fervently, firmly
Something's going on in society
Dancing with the big boys
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
Dancing with the big boys
One wrong word and you're out of sync
Talking bout a hands on policy
Death to the trees
Dancing with the big boys
They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
Dancing with the big boys
There are too many people, too much belief
Dancing with the big boys
Where there's trouble there's poetry
Dancing with the big boys
Your family is a football team
This dot marks your location
Dancing with the big boys
Loneliness in a free society
Dancing with the big boys
This can be embarrassing
Dancing with the big boys
Dancing with the big boys
Ok,  Tokyo
South america, australia, france, germany, uk, africa
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the streets
They're dancing in chicago
Down in new orleans
In new york city
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing,
Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear, just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl, everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street
It's an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
Dancing in the street
Baltimore in dc now
Don't forget the motor city
On the streets of brazil
Back in the ussr
No matter where you are
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl, everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the streets
Way down in l.a., everyday
Dancing in the streets
Cross in china too
Me and you
Dancing in the street
Don't you know
They'll be dancing
Dancing in the street repeat
David BowieBrian EnoCarlos Alomar
I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers kisskiss
Believing me, oh
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers kisskiss
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no kisskiss
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and millions of puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.
Music and Lyrics by Bowie
How come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire I guess the season is on
So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all used up
You break open your million dollar weapon
Still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys
Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
And you'll take me aside
David what shall I do
They wait for me in the hallway
And I'll say don't ask me I don't know any hallways
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
You're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind
You fall to the ground like a leaf from a tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No, no I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
Fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
And there'll be others on the line filing past
Who'll whisper low
I miss you he had to go
Each to his own
Just another piece of teenage wildlife
You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your makeup
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
Oh, oh, oh
What a criminal world
The boys are like babyfaced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like babyfaced boys
You've got a very heavy reputation
But noone knows about your lowlife
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your highlife disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stickup
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
Oh, oh, oh
What a criminal world
The boys are like babyfaced boys
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like babyfaced boys
What a criminal world
What a criminal
What a criminal world
What a criminal
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
For a day
Don't you dare
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think, to look at me,
that I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've noone to talk to, anyway
I can't see the road
for the rain in my eyes
I live above the grocers store,
owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English,
tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation,
I stand without a word to say
I can't see the bridge
for the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts,
my voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb,
noone will recall me
And I can't see the water
through the tears in my eyes
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Columbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
As heard on the Deram Antholgy 1997
Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
ChingALing song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing,
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing,
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing
Doo dah doo doo dah dah, Doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our lovestrong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing,
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing,
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing,
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing,
ChingALing, ChingALing, ChingALing
David BowieIggy Pop
I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel atragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says ... shshshhh
When the sun goes down when the sun goes down
And the bads are back again and the bads are back
The brothers come round the brothers come'round
I get out of my dirty bed my dirty bed
I shake my pretty little head I shake my pretty little head
I tap my pretty little feet I tap my pretty little feet
We're brighter than sunlight
Louder than thunder
Dancing like a yoyo, woo!
Don't got no problems no problems
Ain't got no suitcase no suitcase
Ain't got no clothes to worry about no clothes to worry about
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines binding me, yeah
I just through in my hand through in his his hand
the chilliest bunch in the land in the land
They don't look much
But they're sure chilly chilly
They party till they glow glow, huh
Chilly down with the wild gang
Think small with the wild gang
Bang hips with the wild gang
When you think it's wild
Chilly down with the wild gang
walk tall with the wild gang
Good times, bad food
When you think it's wild
Chilly down, chilly down
Wild and crazy, pretty lazy, high rollin?, funky strolling, ball playing
Hips swaying, trouble making, booty shaking, dripping, passing, jumping
Bouncing, brawling, stylin?, creeping, pouncing, shouting, screaming
Doubledealing, rocknrolling, and oh reeling
With the max in sex appeal
Can you think I grew with feeling?
So when things get too tough get too tough
And your skin is dragging on the ground dragging on the ground
And even down looks up down looks up
We can show you a good time show you a good time
And we don't charge nothing nothing at all
Just strut your nasty stuff
Wiggle in the middle, yeah
Get the town talking, by god
Chilly down with the wild gang
Think small with the wild gang
Bang hips with the wild gang hey, listen up
When you think it's wild
Chilly down with the wild gang
Let's go with the wild gang
Good times, bad food
When you think it's wild
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro
bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro
bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro
bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro
bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro
bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million deadend streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seems the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Chchchchchanges turn and face the strains
Don't wanna be a richer man
Chchchchchanges turn and face the strains
Just gunna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't waste time
So watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
So the days flow through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consulations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
Chchchchchanges turn and face the strains
Don't tell them to grow up a part of it
Chchchchchanges turn and face the strains
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Chchchchchanges turn and face the strains
Ooh look out you rock 'n' rollers
Chchchchchanges turn and face the strains
Pretty soon now you're gonna get a little older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long
And I've been putting out fire
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But it wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru
Well you've been so long
It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
We've been putting out fire
Well it's Been so long so long so long
Yes it's been so long so long so long
I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
And putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
Yeah yeah putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
Been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
Yeah putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
Putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
It's been so long
Been so long so long so long
It's been so long
Been so long so long so long
It's been so long
Been so long so long so long
I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
I'll make you a deal like any other candidate.
We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend.
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
I am having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bulletproof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here thing.
So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres bunch little number whines "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar.
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump into a river holding hands
Questiontime that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends, always been found and I can't
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Now I leave them all in the never never land
The station seems so cold the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name Hi Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ohh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm Faking it all
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right take it in right

There's been many others Oooooooohh so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I, what do I

I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall

Take it in right
Right to your heart
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?
I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you di yi yi yi yine
D A V I D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
So bloody your hands on the cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Once there was a fellow and his name was buzz
He was just a rookie cop, just a baby buzz
He patroled the sunset strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip
He protected you and me from evil women like poor alice d
Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread
And they called her sweet alice the head
Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and std
She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud
Good buzz did the thing that all the good buzz must
Stuck his gun in alice's back and said "this is a buzz"
Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise
Buzz said "what a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination"
Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational
Now they're taking pills in shops, buzz is not afraid of what
Buzz and alice d have shown the way of where the buzz might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch
He's protecting you and me from evil women like poor alice d
Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is english and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in south london
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't crumble at silver and gold
Screaming above central london
Never born, so I'll never get old
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way
Zane, zane, zane
Ouvre le chien
Zane, zane, zane
Ouvre le chien
You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Spinoffs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Baby, I've been
In your room again
Don't look at the carpet,
I drew something awful on it
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems ohohohoh
I'll never touch you
heaven loves ya
the clouds smile for ya
nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
clothes always fit ya
life is the pop of a cherry when you're a boy
when you're a boy
you can where a uniform
when you're a boy
other boys check you out
you get a girl
these are your favorite things
when you're a boy
boys keep swinging
boys always work it out
unpage the colors
unfurl the flag
love just kissed you hello when you're a boy
they'll never clone ya
you're always first on the line when you're a boy
when you're a boy
you can buy a home of your own
when you're a boy
learn to drive and everything
you get a girl
you'll get your share
when you're a boy.
Music and Lyrics by Bowie
Psychodelicate girl  come out to play
Little metal faced boy  don't stay away
He's so war torn and resigned  she can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove  what are they hoping to find
It's love back to front and no sides  like I say
These pieces are broken  like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams
A million scars
He punishes hard  was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know  people I love
They seem so unhappy  dead or alive
It's love back to front and no sides  like I say
These pieces are broken  like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams
A million scars
I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million deadend streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Turn and face the strain
Don't want to be a richer man
Turn and face the strain
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
Turn and face the strain
Don't tell t hem to grow up and out of it
Turn and face the strain
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Turn and face the strain
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Turn and face the strain
Pretty soon you're gonna get a little older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a crazed dad
These are the craze
Easy come come goto go back
In the valley of the dead man walks
How they drank from the jazz
Astral kestrel, fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving you will never get
Shine shine shine
Bleed like crazed dad
These are the craze
Seek for a leather journey never stopped to think about
Hollywood king kong domino on the side
Street light levitated down stop the blue for 5 dollar gonna keep my domino on the side
Street light, looking right looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead put a net through his headache
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a crazed dad
These are the craze
Living on a movie all the shirleycharley films on film
Come together, party footnote on the footstone
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a crazed dad
Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake
The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor
Get me off the streets get some protection
Get me on my feet get some direction
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet wo wo
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout get some protection
Get me on my feet get some direction, woooh!
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets get some protection
Get a second
Get wo wo
Get a second ? breath on advice ?
And a second blow
Getting my facts from a Benneton ad
I'm lookin' thru African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes
Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.
Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.
Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise
Just a fool!
Pack a pack horse and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock
Pack a pack horse and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu
Pack a pack horse and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock
Pack a pack horse and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin
Please savior, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother
I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother
Till the sun blisters and sprays
And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone
I'll be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime, goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone
But I'll be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
I'll roll your ball
Till the stars can't make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
Not at all
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face
Psychodelicate girl  come out to play
Little metal facedboy  don't stay away
They're so wartorn and resigned she can't talk any
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?
It's love back to front and no sides  like I say

So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars
A million scars
A million dreams
Weaving down a byroad, singing the song
That's my kind of highroll gone wrong
Smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank god heaven left us
Standing on our feet
Beauty and the Beast
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Photograph king, watches you go
Now fashions may change, heaven knows, but you
still leave a stain on me
Only to go colours may fade
The seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me
Wrongnegative fadesnever the twain, reckless and tame
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look thru your things

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail
I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said I'm holding you, son
Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang
Wow, this ain't the right thing to do
So, so let, so let's go
Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky
I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
LonelyHa Ha Hawhat does it mean
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Rise to the sky
Well young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Then you close, then you should close, then you close down
You big man
Spot the brack
Just come in first
If praise had wings
And you next in line
Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
getting Baby care
well    Baby
lost    Baby found
talking Baby well
walk    Baby lost
care    Baby talking
walk    Baby lost
Now that he has no sense of destination
Now he's running for the love of speed
When the child goes bad it's no cause for celebration
Like Jimmy Dean he don't talk back to me
Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby no
Hallo humans can you feel me thinking
I assume you're seeing everything I'm thinking
Hallo humans nothing starts tomorrow
I'm the baby now
care     talking
Talking well Talking well
A speck of dust just settled in my eye
It doesn't matter I've seen everything anyway
Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby no
Baby loves that way Yes, she does, yes she does
Baby loves that way Oh, I love my baby
Baby loves that way Ooh, I gotta take her
Baby loves that way Yep, I love her
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
Baby loves that way Oh, I love my baby
Baby loves that way Ooh, she does too much to me
Baby loves that way And I can't think too much of her
Baby loves that way Gotta take her, gotta take her
Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner
Jeanny's my babe and that's alright, yeah
She treats me good, each and every night
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
Baby loves that way I love my baby
Baby loves that way Ooh, she's too much
Baby loves that way Yes she does, yes she does
Baby loves that wayyyy
Baby loves that way I love my baby
Baby loves that way Yeah, she's too much, yeah yeah
Baby loves that way Ooh, I think she can live with me
Baby loves that way Love her, love her, love her
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys
Baby loves that way Obviously this is the end
Baby loves that way Gotta take her
Baby loves that way Ooh yeah
Baby loves that way Can't do enough
Baby loves that way
You have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space
The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile
It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all
It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth
Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I don't know what's coming next
We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
I'm not a big man
It's hard to face the world
It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all
It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth
It can't fall
Test, testing, testing
This, hmmm, Grace is my name
And and I was...um...
It was that phot... a fading photograph of a patch..., a patchwork quilt.
And they've put me on these...
Ramona put me on
these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes ... and I ask
I can still hear some pop...popular musics and aftershocks. Ahhhchoo
See I've been watching a television of um...
in the homelands
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid
Don't you cry
I'll sing you a lullabye
We're walking down the
Street of chance
Where the chance is always
Slim or none
And the intentions unjust
Baby there's nothing to see
I've already been
Down the street of chance
Baby you're so clean
Baby please stay clean
Baby you're so young
Baby please stay young
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, we've already cried
Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him lovebites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulturesoup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead
Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved and I've needed love"
Sordid details following
The shreiking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick...but the planet is growing
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out on heaven's high
Hitting an alltime low
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light...but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I've never done anything out of the blue, wohooh
Want an axe to break the ice
Want to come down right now
My mother said to get things done
You better not mess with Major Tom
There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes.
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes.
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes.
There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams.
A love that will last
Within your heart.
I'll place the moon
Within your heart.
As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for yououou
As the world falls down.
Falling in love.
I'll paint you mornings of gold.
I'll spin you Valentine evenings.
Though we're strangers 'til now,
We're choosing the path
Between the stars.
I'll leave my love
Between the stars.
As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for yououou
As the world falls down.
As the world falls down.
As the world falls down.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Makes no sense at all.
Makes no sense to fall.

I can go anyway way I choose
I can live anyhow win or lose
I can go anywhere for something new
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose
Do anything right or wrong
I can talk anyhow and get along
I don't care anyway I never lose
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose
Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere
I can go anyway way I choose
I can live anyhow win or lose
I can go anywhere for something new
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

This is Andy Warhole and it's take one, take one
It's, it's Warhol actually
What did I say
Whole, it's whole as in wholes
Wah, Andy War hol, Andy War hol he
Like whole hub
Are you ready
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise hm hm hm
When he wakes up on the sea
He sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a playgirl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know
She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
It's a long long romance
Well, she's out to slay
Well, she's got it made
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know
And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool I'm a fool
I can't get what I want
And it makes me sad
I can't get what I want
And it makes me mad
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me,
Oh, I feel so sad
She's making me mad
And I say to myself
That I love her
And I say to myself that I need her
Oh, I need her
And I say to myself I'm a fool
And I say to myself
I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of the Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate were strong for you...
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
An Occasional Dream
An Occasional Dream
An Occasional Dream
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam
Hey, hey, ada kapal layar
Dari jalan ke Jawa jagajaga,
Jika ada orang Bugis
Hey, hey, ini mimpi
Kukan bakarmu jika kau harus pergi
Hey, hey, kubakan
Jika kau baring di balai bambu

Tak pernah kulihat permata seindah ini
Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Lautan atau mimpi
Tentang patung putri
Hey, hey, patung raja,
Dikalungi mawar emas
Hey, hey, kanakkanak, tewas di tempat

Heyhey it's the tall sail
On a beach reach for java
Make way for to Java
Watching for Boogies
Heyhey it's a dreaming
I would burn you if you should die
Heyhey I would burn too
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre
I dream of Amlapura
Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura
Of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
Heyhey golden roses around
A rajah's mouth
Heyhey all the dead children buried standing
A flying Dutchman
Smoking gun and spice wind
I dream of Amlapura
Of a princess in stone
Heyhey it's a tall ship
Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
Never looking left or right
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car
Jasmine, I saw you weaping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
Round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much
Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown
I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance
You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all
As The World Falls Down
There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I'll place the sky within your eyes
There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill he's caused
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for youoooo
As the world falls down
As the world Falling down
Falling in love
I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing the path between the stars
I'll leave my love between the stars
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill he's caused
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for youoooo
As the world falls down
As the world Falling down
As the world falls down
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
As the world falls down
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Falling in love
Falling in love love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cause it's such a long way down
So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all...am I?
Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane
Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sadmen
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

Hate that same old game

Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small
Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, from paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children, oooo, that's all, after all
Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown
Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down
Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children
oooo, That's all, after all
I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords,
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children at all, oooo, after all
Live to your rebirth and do what you will
Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill
Oh by jingo
After all, after all
African nightmare onetime Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of God on high
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days got get work through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days, got get work through one of these days

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of God on high
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of God on high
Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days got get work through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through

I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Noth, nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Hey yeah, Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change it nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it no no no no no
Nothing's gonna change my world nothing's gonna change my world
I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Spit upon that
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't
Travel so far these days
The talk of your lifes
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Swings thru the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days
Spit on that
He never knew what hit him
And it him so
He pushed back the pigmen
I was a stranger in the city
Out of town where the people I knew
I had the feeling of selfpity
What to do? what to do? what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've ever known
A foggy day in a london town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles had'nt passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London Town the sun was shining everywhere
To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings
I know, I know
How can I help you?
You're just a wannabe
I'm a believer
You're a sex receiver
And me with a big hurt
You know I had a big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
'Cause you're my roommate from hell
Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
Speak in extremes
It'll save you time
You were a saint abroad
But a devil at home
Come on here, woowoo
And kiss it for me
To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
Even a glass eye in a duck's ass can see that
I know, I know
How can I help you?
I'm hit with a big hurt
You know I had
A great big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
And here come the indians oooo
Kiss it for me, woowoo
Kiss it for me
Woowoo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woowoo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts
Kiss it for me
Come on here, woowoo
Woowoo, woowoo, woowoo, woowoo
Kiss it for me
Please don't tell us were the sun goes
Please take back this fear of anger
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain, all this sorrow
I demand a better future
For I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
We told you
We walk too
How many tears must fall
Nothing is you
I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
I'm changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down
Angels have gone
I'm jumping tracks
I'm changing towns
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
All of my life
Angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them
Thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Strange sandy eyes
Angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
All of my life
Forever I'm out here forever
Someday they won't let you, so now you must agree
The times they are atelling,
and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's neverthere
Beware the savage jaw
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 who could ask for more
1984 who could ask for mororororore
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of MayDay
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind no
And only you
Rocket on thru the sky
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
Yeah it couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
When the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the bigg guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream no
And only you
Race on to wonder where
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murder on the heels of love
Just a ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
Well it couldn't be done with dogs
Well it couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry Cry Cry
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry Cry Cry

'87 and Cry Cry Cry Cry Cry

Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat themjust for one day

'Cause we're loversand that is a fact
Yes we're loversand that is that
Though nothingwill keep us together
We could steal timejust for one day
We can be heroesfor ever and ever
What do you say?
II can remember
Standingby the wall
And the gunsshot above our heads
And we kissedas though nothing could fall
And the shamewas on the other side
Oh we can beat themforever and ever
Then we could be heroesjust for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhoh, oh, oh, ohhh, just for one day
Oh just for a day
Come on strong, girl
Oh, lay your heavy trip on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
Oh, right on!
Come on, you mothers!
Keep your mouth shut
And listen to the word inside
Keep your head on
And open up your eyes real wide
Keep the change, love
Let me fix it for you inside
There isn't any room to hide
Take it all, take it all
If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
"where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
It's too easy to say
But the service just a game a gameameameame
I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score
Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love  feel you put them on the ground
Your love could feel you with devotion
I'm an alligator, I'm a mamapapa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a big monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!
Freak out, far out, in out
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five,
Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
"Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do."

Summertime when will you come?
I wanna put my light things on
I wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day
I want those peaches on the table
Want the watermelon red
And the warm sun creeping through the window
To ease me out of bed
I want the sand out there to lie on
And the sea out there to swim
So my heart can take a holiday
From breaking over him
Summertime when will you come?
I wanna put my light things on
Wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day
And I want to drive forever
Wanna roll my windows down
Get the breeze back on my body
Get my feet back on the ground
I want the sand out there to lie on
And the sea out there to swim
So my heart can take a holiday
From breaking over here
Summertime when will you come?
I wanna put my light things on
I wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day
I cannot follow you, my love,
you cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
all of the moments that we will be.
You know who I am,
you've stared at the sun,
well I am the one who loves
changing from nothing to one.
Sometimes I need you naked,
sometimes I need you wild,
I need you to carry my children in
and I need you to kill a child.
You know who I am...
If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
and I will leave with you one broken man
whom I will teach you to repair.
You know who I am...
I cannot follow you, my love,
you cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
all of the moments that we will be.
You know who I am...
You Have the Lovers
You have the lovers,
they are nameless, their histories only for each other,
and you have the room, the bed, and the windows.
Pretend it is a ritual.
Unfurl the bed, bury the lovers, blacken the windows,
let them live in that house for a generation or two.
No one dares disturb them.
Visitors in the corridor tiptoe past the long closed door,
they listen for sounds, for a moan, for a song
nothing is heard, not even breathing.
You know they are not dead,
you can feel the presence of their intense love.
Your children grow up, they leave you,
they have become soldiers and riders.
Your mate dies after a life of service.
Who knows you? Who remembers you?
But in your house a ritual is in progress
It is not finished it needs more people.
One day the door is opened to the lover's chamber.
The room has become a dense garden,
full of colours, smells, sounds you have never known.
The bed is smooth as a wafer of sunlight,
in the midst of the garden it stands alone.
In the bed the lovers, slowly and deliberately and silently,
perform the act of love.
Their eyes are closed,
as tightly as if heavy coins of flesh lay on them.
Their lips are bruised with new and old bruises.
Her hair and his beard are hopelessly tangled.
When he puts his mouth against her shoulder
she is uncertain whether her shoulder
has given or received the kiss.
All her flesh is like a mouth.
He carries his fingers along her waist
and feels his own waist caressed.
She holds him closer and his own arms tighten around her.
She kisses the hand besider her mouth.
It is his hand or her hand, it hardly matters,
there are so many more kisses.
You stand beside the bed, weeping with happiness,
you carefully peel away the sheets
from the slowmoving bodies.
Your eyes filled with tears, you barely make out the lovers,
As you undress you sing out, and your voice is magnificent
because now you believe it is the first human voice
heard in that room.
The garments you let fall grow into vines.
You climb into bed and recover the flesh.
You close your eyes and allow them to be sewn shut.
You create an embrace and fall into it.
There is only one moment of pain or doubt
as you wonder how many multitudes are lying beside your body,
but a mouth kisses and a hand soothes the moment away.
I said I'd be your lover.
You laughed at what I said.
I lost my job forever.
I was counted with the dead.
I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know
That I am not the one who loves
It's love that seizes me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.
And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger,
You whisper, "You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover."
I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know
That I am not the one who loves
It's love that chooses me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.
And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger . . .
I'm gonna take you down
Deep down, to the front line
You woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun,
Mama always said you'd be
The Chosen One.
She said You're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine,
But you were born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.
When you woke up this morning
All that love had gone,
Your Papa never told you
About right and wrong.
But you're looking good, baby,
I believe that you're a feeling fine,shame about it,
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes.
So sing it now
Woke up this morning
Got a blue moon
Got a blue moon in your eyes
God damned shame about it
You woke up this morning
The world turned upside down, Lord above,
Thing's ain't been the same
Since the Blues walked into town.
But you're one in a million
You've got that shotgun shine. shame about it,
Born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.
When you woke up this morning everything was gone.
By half past ten your head was going dingdong.
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should
know. Last night you were flying but today you're so low
 ain't it times like these that make you wonder if
you'll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to
the others wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you
didn't think beyond the next paycheck and the next little
Well you do so make up your mind to go on, ?cos
when you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
You want to be,
You want to be the Chosen One.
Yeah, you know it.
Just can't help yourself, yeah.
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun
Trav'ling lady, stay awhile
until the night is over.
I'm just a station on your way,
I know I'm not your lover.
Well I lived with a child of snow
when I was a soldier,
and I fought every man for her
until the nights grew colder.
She used to wear her hair like you
except when she was sleeping,
and then she'd weave it on a loom
of smoke and gold and breathing.
And why are you so quiet now
standing there in the doorway?
You chose your journey long before
you came upon this highway.
Trav'ling lady stay awhile
until the night is over.
I'm just a station on your way,
I know I'm not your lover.
Why don't you try to do without him?
Why don't you try to live alone?
Do you really need his hands for your passion?
Do you really need his heart for your throne?
Do you need his labour for your baby?
Do you need his beast for the bone?
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady?
I know you're going to make, make it on your own.
Why don't your try to forget him?
Just open up your dainty little hand.
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions,
many satisfying onenight stands.
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower?
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave?
Do you want to give your blessing to his power
as he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave.
I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony,
well, that is if I remember the way.
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery,
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray.
You can see they've finally taken cover,
they're willing, yeah they're willing to obey.
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other,
so let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way.
Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic"
Angels We told you so
We told you dear
You didn't have
To come here
The human life
Is full of quirks
We can't work it out
It's a lemon
Live, love, suffer
Die and panic
It lives, it loves
Suffers and dies
It eats cow's meat
And apple pies
Dumb, dumb, dumb
And full of fear
Anxiety and strife..
This is the human life!
...We have many duties still
Much gold and silver light to spill
On anxious boys and frightened girls like you...

way down, way way down

you're got me way down, way way down,
way way down deep
you're got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down,
way way down deep
it came to me this morning
I was walking down the street
was like my soul could taste you
and God, you tasted sweet
finally I can breathe again
finally I can speak
I've got you in the glory place
I've got you way down deep
I've got you way down, way way down,

it's a funny feeling
but I cannot say I mind
I know that I'm dealing with
a love that's far from blind
I see every single angle
I look before I leap
how else can I put it
when you're got me way down deep
you've got me way down, way way down,
way way down deep
you've got me way down, way way down,
way way down deep
you've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down,

don't matter what we gave away
was nothing we could keep
don't matter what we gave away
you know that talk is cheap
forgive me if I hate you
you're a liar and a thief
but I've got you in the glory place
I got you way down deep
you've got me way down, way way down ...
don't matter if the road is long
don't matter if it's steep
don't matter if the moon goes out
and darkness is complete
don't matter if we lose our way
I know were gonna meet
I've got you in the glory place
I've got you way down deep
you've got me way down, way way down ..

Baby, I've been waiting
I've been waiting night and day
I didn't see the time
I waited half my life away
There were many invitations
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting
For the miracle to come
I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
I know it must have hurt you
It must have hurt your pride
To stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
While I was waiting
For the miracle to come
You wouldn't like it baby
You wouldn't like it here
There's not much entertainment
And the critics are severe
The Maestro says it's Mozart
But it sounds like bubble gum
When you're waiting
For the miracle to come
Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do
I haven't been this happy
Since the end of World War II
Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
For the miracle to come
I dreamed about you, baby
It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
But some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
>From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle to come
Baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Let's do something crazy
Something absolutely wrong
While we're waiting
For the miracle to come
When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain
And they ask you how you're feeling
Of course you say you can't complain
If you're squeezed for information
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting
For the miracle to come
Baby, I've been waiting,
I've been waiting night and day.
I didn't see the time,
I waited half my life away.
There were lots of invitations
and I know you sent me some,
but I was waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
I know you really loved me.
but, you see, my hands were tied.
I know it must have hurt you,
it must have hurt your pride
to have to stand beneath my window
with your bugle and your drum,
and me I'm up there waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
Ah I don't believe you'd like it,
You wouldn't like it here.
There ain't no entertainment
and the judgements are severe.
The Maestro says it's Mozart
but it sounds like bubble gum
when you're waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do.
I haven't been this happy
since the end of World War II.
Nothing left to do
when you know that you've been taken.
Nothing left to do

Ah baby, let's get married,

Let's be alone together.
Let's see if we're that strong.
Yeah let's do something crazy,
something absolutely wrong
while we're waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.
Nothing left to do ...
When you've fallen on the highway
and you're lying in the rain,
and they ask you how you're doing
of course you'll say you can't complain 
If you're squeezed for information,
that's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting

From bitter searching of the heart,
Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part.
This is the faith from which we start
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart.
We loved the easy and the smart,
But now, with keener hand and brain,
We rise to play a greater part.
The lesser loyalties depart,
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart.
Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain,
We rise to play a greater part.
Reshaping narrow law and art
Whose symbols are the millions slain,
From bitter searching of the heart
We rise to play a greater part.
I set out one night
When the tide was low
There were signs in the sky
But I did not know
I'd be caught in the grip
Of the undertow
Ditched on a beach
Where the sea hates to go
With a child in my arms
And a chill in my soul
And my heart the shape
Of a begging bowl

Et ma patrie, helas! And my native land, alas!

As the mist leaves no scar
On the dark green hill
So my body leaves no scar
On you and never will
Through windows in the dark
The children come, the children go
Like arrows with no targets
Like shackles made of snow
True love leaves no traces
If you and I are one
It's lost in our embraces
Like stars against the sun
As a falling leaf may rest
A moment on the air
So your head upon my breast
So my breath upon your hair
And many nights endure
Without a moon or star
So we will endure
When one is gone and far
True love leaves no traces
If you and I are one
It's lost in our embraces
Like stars against the sun
Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past.
We swore to each other then that our love would surely last.
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast,
now I am too thin and your love is too vast.
But I know from your eyes
and I know from your smile
that tonight will be fine,
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
for a while.
I choose the rooms that I live in with care,
the windows are small and the walls almost bare,
there's only one bed and there's only one prayer
I listen all night for your step on the stair.
But I know from your eyes
and I know from your smile
that tonight will be fine,
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
for a while.
Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me,
she's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
and she's moving her body so brave and so free.
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory.
And I know from her eyes
and I know from her smile
that tonight will be fine,
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
for a while.

Let me start with you Miss Shy
Bundled up in your mother's lie
Tip toe, tip toe
Hiding your silky pleasure
Miss Shy come to me
Along the snowy paths of modesty
Tip toe, tip toe
Hiding your silky treasure
Come to me with downcast eyes
Come to me and claim the prize
Of your outrageous pleasure
How I like you Miss Shy
Bundled up in your mother's lie
Tip toe 
Claim your outrageous pleasure!

And you I want strong
With your hatred intact
With your father's pipe
And your brother's bat
And your quaint belief
In holy authority
With your discipline
And your Darwin claws
And your legal eye
On the peacock's flaws
I see what fallen man
Was meant to be
With your absolute
No man can refute
Your absolutely unique
Contempt for the weak
Down on our paws
There are no laws
Kiss me where I can not speak
You I want strong
With your hatred intact
With your father's pipe
And your brother's bat
Now kiss me
Where I cannot speak!

You I want for my friend
To gossip with me and drink tea
To walk down by the river's bend
You I want for my friend
To watch the water going by
The swallows climbing above
To tell me that I lie
When I tell you I cannot love,
To know my heart better than me
To be my friend in charity
To speak of lovers old and new
To say to me, what they've done to you
You I want for my friend
To make some sense of our difference
To eat and drink together
To comfort one another,
And may our conversation never end!
o o o
I want your
Sight but my
So none may know
Or hear you moan
To an infant thumb
You will be
True to me
There will be no
For I will weave
A cloak so tight
About your loveliness
No man will ever guess
The wild commands you whisper
From your childhood to the night
Drops the moon
About a man
Him tidal to
And lets your nipples
harden I can
Hear you moan
To an infant thumb
And you I want
To wink at me
And you I want
To think of me
You I want above
I want you below
You I want veiled
And you to know
I want you clumbsy
I want you skilled
You be ferocious
You be mild...
You be foolish
You be wise
You stay here
You stay outside
You comb out your hair
You keep it curled
I want, I want, I want
I want to know the world
You comb out your hair
You keep yours curled
I want, I want to know the world!

Who did not come tonight
I will wait for you
Who are not born
I will write for you
Who must appear
In veils of chance
I will kneel
I will kneel
Like a child
Who's watching Mary
As she stands
Upon the air
In gentle splendour
In the black
Mouth of a cave
Openarmed and radiant
To save mankind
And all the broken
World to mother
And I swear
By the obscure
The unrequited greed
The deep light
Of my soul
And covered over
Intrigues of pride
Whose mercy is
To let me sing
That I will be
For the one
Who will not come
I swear that
I will be
There is a war between the rich and poor,
a war between the man and the woman.
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war
and the ones who say there isn't.
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it,
why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning.
Well I live here with a woman and a child,
the situation makes me kind of nervous.
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love"
I call it service.
Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist,
why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us,
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous.
You cannot stand what I've become,
you much prefer the gentleman I was before.
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control,
I didn't even know there was a war.
Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed,
why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married.
There is a war between the rich and poor,
a war between the man and the woman.
There is a war between the left and right,
a war between the black and white,
a war between the odd and the even.
Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden,
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even,
why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking?

Oh my love, you are the shadow.
I go stumbling through tonight.
And our love, just smoke and ashes
Of a flame that once burned bright.
Do not go! I cannot follow!
I'm so thirsty for the kiss.
Ah that does not end in sorrow
And a thirstiness like this.
Now I sing this for the captain
Who's ship was never built
For the mother in confusion
Who's wound cannot be fixed.
For the heart with no companion,
For the soul without a key.
For the prima ballerina,
Who cannot dance to anything.
For the heart with no companion,
For the soul without a key.
For the prima ballerina
Who cannot dance to anything.

Oh do not go! I cannot follow!
I'm so thirsty for the kiss.
Don't either does not end in sorrow,
And a thirsting for your kiss.
La da da da...
When it all went down
And the pain came through
I get it now
I was there for you
Don't ask me how
I know it's true
I get it now
I was there for you
I make my plans
Like I always do
But when I look back
I was there for you
I walk the streets
Like I used to do
And I freeze with fear
But I'm there for you
I see my life
In full review
It was never me
It was always you
You sent me here
You sent me there
I can't repair
Out of thoughts
By thinking not
And drinking wine
A body that
I thought was mine
Dressed as Arab
Dressed as Jew
O mask of iron
I was there for you
Moods of glory
Moods so foul
The world comes through
A bloody towel
And death is old
But it's always new
I freeze with fear
And I'm there for you
I see it clear
I always knew
It was never me
I was there for you
I was there for you
My darling one
And by your law
It all was done
Why do you stand by the window
Abandoned to beauty and pride
The thorn of the night in your bosom
The spear of the age in your side
Lost in the rages of fragrance
Lost in the rags of remorse
Lost in the waves of a sickness
That loosens the high silver nerves
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole brokenhearted host
Gentle this soul
And come forth from the cloud of anoint
And kiss the cheek of the moon
The New Jerusalem glowing
Why tarry all night in the ruin
And leave no word of discomfort
And leave no observer to mourn
But climb on your tears and be silent
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love...
Then lay your rose on the fire
The fire give up to the sun
The sun give over to splendour
In the arms of the high holy one
For the holy one dreams of a letter
Dreams of a letter's death
Oh bless thee continuous stutter
Of the word being made into flesh
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love...
Gentle this soul
Now the Swan it floated on the English river
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer
and the judges watched us from the other side
I told my mother "Mother I must leave you
preserve my room but do not shed a tear
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere"
But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame
She said at last I was her finest lover
and if she withered I would be to blame
The judges said you missed it by a fraction
rise up and brace your troops for the attack
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action
Oh see the men of action falling back
But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still
My falsity had stung me like a hornet
The poison sank and it paralysed my will
I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers
that they had been deserted from above
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona
I'm listed with the enemies of love
And long ago she said "I must be leaving,
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan"
So daily I renew my idle duty
I touch her here and there  I know my place
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty
and people call me traitor to my face

Angels Blindly he worked
At his third invention
Taking the chances
Of one who is lost
Feeling his way
To a cleaner expression
Of whatever it was
He stumbled across
All for the sake
Of a possible woman
He goaded himself
With a technical hope
For the sake of his longing
We came to the window
He put on his cloths
And he walked through the smoke
All for the sake
Of an interested woman
Riding to him
On a flicker of hope
Some tourist of beauty
In full disappointment
Ready to fall
In love with a ghost
And here was his ghost
With his third invention
The usual claim
To the highest reward
And now it was ready
His third invention
Ready to fall
In love with the world
And he falls back
And she comes forward
The eye of his labour
Measures them both
And she lies in the arms
Of his third invention
And back in his room
He commences the fourth
This is the work
Of the highest pretension
Ode to the world
O deep in comfort
O full employment
He's lost to the fourth
He's lost to the third.
It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender.
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much
not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.
And then leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger.
But now another stranger seems to want you to ignore his dreams
as though they were the burden of some other
O you've seen that man before
his golden arm dispatching cards
but now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.
You hate to watch another tired man
lay down his hand
like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
you notice there's a highway
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling up like smoke above his shoulder.
You tell him to come in sit down
but something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close you shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger.
Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
we'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
to get me to the heart of this
or any other matter
Well he talks like this
you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this,
you don't know what he's after.
Let's meet tomorrow if you chose
upon the shore, beneath the bridge
that they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform
for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.
And then sweeping up the jokers
that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much
not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.
And leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains
he'll say I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger.
I've never seen your eyes so wide
I've never seen your appetite quite this occupied
Elsewhere is your feast of love
I know ... where long ago we agreed to keep it light
So lets be married one more night
It's light, light enough
To let it go
It's light enough to let it go
Remember when the scenery started fading
I held you til you learned to walk on air
So don't look down the ground is gone,
there's no one waiting anyway
The Smoky Life is practiced
So set your restless heart at ease
Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves
They waste no time waiting for the snow
Don't argue now you'll be late
There is nothing to investigate
It's light enough, light enough
To let it go
Light enough to let it go
Remember when the scenery started fading
I held you til you learned to walk on air
So don't look down the ground is gone,
there's no one waiting anyway
The Smoky Life is practiced everywhere
Come on back if the moment lends
You can look up all my very closest friends
Light, light enough
To let it go
It's light enough to let it go
When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
this I could not do
I took my gun and vanished.
I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
but I have many friends,
and some of them are with me.
An old woman gave us shelter,
kept us hidden in the garret,
then the soldiers came
she died without a whisper.
There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
but I must go on
the frontiers are my prison.
Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come
then we'll come from the shadows.

I finally broke into the prison,
I found my place in the chain.
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows,
all the brave young men
they're waiting now to see a signal
which some killer will be lighting for pay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
you whom I cannot betray.
I fought in the old revolution
on the side of the ghost and the King.
Of course I was very young
and I thought that we were winning
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
as they carry the bodies away.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...
Lately you've started to stutter
as though you had nothing to say.
To all of my architects let me be traitor.
Now let me say I myself gave the order
to sleep and to search and to destroy.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...
Yes, you who are broken by power,
you who are absent all day,
you who are kings for the sake of your children's story,
the hand of your beggar is burdened down with money,
the hand of your lover is clay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...
I went down to the place
Where I knew she lay waiting
Under the marble and the snow
I said, Mother I'm frightened
The thunder and the lightning
I'll never come through this alone
She said, I'll be with you
My shawl wrapped around you
My hand on your head when you go
And the night came on
It was very calm
I wanted the night to go on and on
But she said, Go back to the World
We were fighting in Egypt
When they signed this agreement
That nobody else had to die
There was this terrible sound
And my father went down
With a terrible wound in his side
He said, Try to go on
Take my books, take my gun
Remember, my son, how they lied
And the night comes on
It's very calm
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
But you don't want to lie, not to the young
We were locked in this kitchen
I took to religion
And I wondered how long she would stay
I needed so much
To have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way
But my son and my daughter
Climbed out of the water
Crying, Papa, you promised to play
And they lead me away
To the great surprise
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the World
Now I look for her always
I'm lost in this calling
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer
Saying, When will she summon me
When will she come to me
What must I do to prepare
When she bends to my longing
Like a willow, like a fountain
She stands in the luminous air
And the night comes on
And it's very calm
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song
Now the crickets are singing
The vesper bells ringing
The cat's curled asleep in his chair
I'll go down to Bill's Bar
I can make it that far
And I'll see if my friends are still there
Yes, and here's to the few
Who forgive what you do
And the fewer who don't even care
And the night comes on
It's very calm
I want to cross over, I want to go home
But she says, Go back, go back to the World
How many times did you call me
And I knew it was late
I left everybody
But I never went straight
I don't claim to be guilty
But I do understand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
Now my heart's like a blister
From doing what I do
If the moon has a sister
It's got to be you
I'm going to miss you forever
Tho' it's not what I planned
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
Now the deal has been dirty
Since dirty began
I'm not asking for mercy
Not from the man
You just don't ask for mercy
While you're still on the stand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
I don't claim to be guilty
Guilty's too grand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
That's all I can say, baby
That's all I can say
It wasn't for nothing
That they put me away
I fell with my angel
Down the chain of command
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
A wandering Canadian,
banned from his hearths,
travelled while crying
travelled while crying
in foreign lands.
One day, sad and pensive,
sitting by the flowing waters,
to the fleeing current
he addressed these words
to the fleeing current
he addressed these words
"If you see my country,
my unhappy country,
go tell my friends
that I remember them.
go tell my friends
that I remember them.
O days so full of charms,
you have vanished...
And my native land, alas!
I will see it no more.
And my native land, alas!
I will see it no more.

Assis au bord des flots,
Au courant fugitif
Il adressa ces mots

"Si tu vois mon pays,
Mon pays malheureux,

Que je me souviens d'eux.

You never liked to get
The letters that I sent.
But now you've got the gist
Of what my letters meant.
You're reading them again,
The ones you didn't burn.
You press them to your lips,
My pages of concern.
I said there'd been a flood.
I said there's nothing left.
I hoped that you would come.
I gave you my address.
Your story was so long,
The plot was so intense,
It took you years to cross
The lines of selfdefense.
The wounded forms appear
The loss, the full extent
And simple kindness here,
The solitude of strength.
You walk into my room.
You stand there at my desk,
Begin your letter to
The one who's coming next.
How many times did you call me
And I knew it was late
I left everybody
But I never went straight
I don't claim to be guilty
But I do understand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

Don't really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.
I don't know why I come here,
Knowing as I do,
What you really think of me,
What I really think of you.
For the millions in a prison,
That wealth has set apart
For the Christ who has not risen,
From the caverns of the heart
For the innermost decision,
That we cannot but obey 
For what's left of our religion,
I lift my voice and pray
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.
I know I said I'd meet you,
I'd meet you at the store,
But I can't buy it, baby.
I can't buy it anymore.
And I don't really know who sent me,
To raise my voice and say
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.
I don't know why I come here,
knowing as I do,
what you really think of me,
what I really think of you.
For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey
For what's left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.
And where, where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor
whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee
She says, "My body is the light, my body is the way"
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?...
Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood
And there is no man or woman who can't be touched
But you who come between them will be judged
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?...
The sea so deep and blind
The sun, the wild regret
The club, the wheel, the mind,
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The club, the wheel, the mind
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The blood, the soil, the faith
These words you can't forget
Your vow, your holy place
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The blood, the soil, the faith
O love, aren't you tired yet?
A cross on every hill
A star, a minaret
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet?
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The sea so deep and blind
Where still the sun must set
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet?
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet?
Now the Captain called me to his bed
He fumbled for my hand
"Take these silver bars," he said
"I'm giving you command."
"Command of what, there's no one here
There's only you and me 
All the rest are dead or in retreat
Or with the enemy."
"Complain, complain, that's all you've done
Ever since we lost
If it's not the Crucifixion
Then it's the Holocaust."
"May Christ have mercy on your soul
For making such a joke
Amid these hearts that burn like coal
And the flesh that rose like smoke."
"I know that you have suffered, lad,
But suffer this awhile
Whatever makes a soldier sad
Will make a killer smile."
"I'm leaving, Captain, I must go
There's blood upon your hand
But tell me, Captain, if you know
Of a decent place to stand."
"There is no decent place to stand
In a massacre
But if a woman take your hand
Go and stand with her."
"I left a wife in Tennessee
And a baby in Saigon 
I risked my life, but not to hear
Some countrywestern song."
"Ah but if you cannot raise your love
To a very high degree,
Then you're just the man I've been thinking of 
So come and stand with me."
"Your standing days are done," I cried,
"You'll rally me no more.
I don't even know what side
We fought on, or what for."
"I'm on the side that's always lost
Against the side of Heaven
I'm on the side of Snakeeyes tossed
Against the side of Seven.
And I've read the Bill of Human Rights
And some of it was true
But there wasn't any burden left
So I'm laying it on you."
Now the Captain he was dying
But the Captain wasn't hurt
The silver bars were in my hand
pinned them to my shirt.
I came upon a butcher,
he was slaughtering a lamb,
I accused him there
with his tortured lamb.
He said, "Listen to me, child,
I am what I am and you, you are my only son."
Well, I found a silver needle,
I put it into my arm.
It did some good,
did some harm.
But the nights were cold
and it almost kept me warm,
how come the night is long?
I saw some flowers growing up
where that lamb fell down
was I supposed to praise my Lord,
make some kind of joyful sound?
He said, "Listen, listen to me now,
I go round and round
and you, you are my only child."
Do not leave me now,
do not leave me now,
I'm broken down
from a recent fall.
Blood upon my body
and ice upon my soul,
lead on, my son, it is your world.
I was dancin' with my darlin'
to the Tennessee Waltz
when an old friend I happened to see.
I introduced him to my darlin'
and while they were dancin'
my friend stole my sweetheart from me.
I remember the night
and the Tennessee Waltz
'cause I know just how much I have lost.
Yes, I lost my little darlin'
the night they were playing
that beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I remember the night ...
She goes dancin' with the darkness
to the Tennessee Waltz
and I feel like I'm falling apart
and it's stronger than drink
and it's deeper than sorrow
this darkness she left in my heart
I remember the night ...
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
This transcription is an improvisation!
And the Holston river sparkles in the moonlight
Well the British ? mountain towers o'r the valley
Still the arms of Regina reach for me.
Now I'm a going back to see Regina
Still the Holston valley sparkles in the moonlight sunlight
Still the Holston river rushes to the sea
Still the Planeish? mountain towers o'r the valley
Still the arms of Regina reach for me.
let's do that once again
Still the Holston valley sparkles in the moon light
Still the Holston river rushes through the sea
Still the Plainish mountain towers o'r the valley
Still the arms of Regina reach for me
Still the arms of Regina reach for me...
let's get out of here...
Let's get out of this place hum hum hum, What are we...
I fought against the bottle, but i had to do it drunk
Took my diamond to the pawn show, but that dont make it junk
I know that im forgiven, but i dont know how i know
I dont trust my innerfeelings, you know feelings come and go
how come you called me here tonight?
how come you bother with my heart at all?
you raised me up in grace,
then you put me in a place where i must fall
too late to mix another drink, the lights are goin out
ill just listen to the darkness and i know what thats about
I tried to love you my way
but i couldnt make it whole
so i close the book of longing
and i do what i am told
how come you called me here tonight?
how come you bother with my heart at all?
you raised me up in grace,
then you put me in a place where i must fall
I fought against the bottle, but i had to do it drunk
Took my diamond to the pawn show, but that dont make it junk
I fought against the bottle, but i had to do it drunk
Took my diamond to the pawn show, but that dont make it junk

I met a woman long ago
her hair the black that black can go,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no.
I met a girl across the sea,
her hair the gold that gold can be,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee.
I met a man who lost his mind
in some lost place I had to find,
follow me the wise man said,
but he walked behind.
I walked into a hospital
where none was sick and none was well,
when at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all.
Morning came and then came noon,
dinner time a scalpel blade
lay beside my silver spoon.
Some girls wander by mistake
into the mess that scalpels make.
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break.
One morning I woke up alone,
the hospital and the nurses gone.
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone.
I ate and ate and ate,
no I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate.
I spent my hatred everyplace,
on every work on every face,
someone gave me wishes
and I wished for an embrace.
Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men,
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again.
I was handsome I was strong,
I knew the words of every song.
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong.
Who is it whom I address,
who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest.
Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one.
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child,
are your lessons done?
are your lessons done?
are your lessons done?
Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the heldhigh
razor, shivering every ram and son?
And now the silent loony bin, where
The shadows live in the rafters like
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
lures them to exaggerate
Mountainsize on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
to praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
of a wet red tongue?
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
and rest because he had finally come?
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.
Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallways where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years
There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!"
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ...
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, Oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now. It's all that there is.
Many men have loved the bells
you fastened to the rein,
and everyone who wanted you
they found what they will always want again.
Your beauty lost to you yourself
just as it was lost to them.
Oh take this longing from my tongue,
whatever useless things these hands have done.
Let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one you love.
Your body like a searchlight
my poverty revealed,
I would like to try your charity
until you cry, "Now you must try my greed."
And everything depends upon
how near you sleep to me
Just take this longing from my tongue
all the lonely things my hands have done.
Let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one your love.
Hungry as an archway
through which the troops have passed,
I stand in ruins behind you,
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.
I love to see you naked over there
especially from the back.
Oh take this longing from my tongue,
all the useless things my hands have done,
untie for me your hired blue gown,
like you would do for one that you love.
You're faithful to the better man,
I'm afraid that he left.
So let me judge your love affair
in this very room where I have sentenced
mine to death.
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
that he's shaken from his head.
Just take this longing from my tongue,
all the useless things my hands have done,
let me see your beauty broken down,
like you would do for one you love.
Like you would do for one you love.
Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows that the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long stem rose
Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Ah give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
Ah when you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows
And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows
And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Oh everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes

Summertime when will you come?
I wanna put my light things on
I wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day
I want those peaches on the table
Want the watermelon red
And the warm sun creeping through the window
To ease me out of bed
I want the sand out there to lie on
And the sea out there to swim
So my heart can take a holiday
From breaking over him
Summertime when will you come?
I wanna put my light things on
Wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day
And I want to drive forever
Wanna roll my windows down
Get the breeze back on my body
Get my feet back on the ground
I want the sand out there to lie on
And the sea out there to swim
So my heart can take a holiday
From breaking over here
Summertime when will you come?
I wanna put my light things on
I wanna put my winter life away
Summertime I need a sunny day
The door it opened slowly,
my father he came in,was nine years old.
And he stood so tall above me,
his blue eyes they were shining
and his voice was very cold.
He said, "I've had a vision
and you know I'm strong and holy,
I must do what I've been told."
So he started up the mountain,
I was running, he was walking,
and his axe was made of gold.
Well, the trees they got much smaller,
the lake a lady's mirror,
we stopped to drink some wine.
Then he threw the bottle over.
Broke a minute later
and he put his hand on mine.
Thought I saw an eagle
but it might have been a vulture,
I never could decide.
Then my father built an altar,
he looked once behind his shoulder,
he knew I would not hide.
You who build these altars now
to sacrifice these children,
you must not do it anymore.
A scheme is not a vision
and you never have been tempted
by a demon or a god.
You who stand above them now,
your hatchets blunt and bloody,
you were not there before,
when I lay upon a mountain
and my father's hand was trembling
with the beauty of the word.
And if you call me brother now,
forgive me if I inquire,
"Just according to whose plan?"
When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must,
I will help you if I can.
When it all comes down to dust
I will help you if I must,
I will kill you if I can.
And mercy on our uniform,
man of peace or man of war,
the peacock spreads his fan.
from the album 'SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN'
The stories of the street are mine, the Spanish voices laugh.
The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas,
and I lean from my window sill in this old hotel I chose,
yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose.
I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come,
the cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone.
But let me ask you one more time, O children of the dusk,
All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us?
And where do all these highways go, now that we are free?
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?
O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel,
You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal.
The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask
the nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass.
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite,
and one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night.
O come with me my little one, we will find that farm
and grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm.
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am,
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb.
With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world.
We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky,
and lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.

Michael We were chosen, we were chosen
Miles and miles apart
I to love your kingdom
You to love my heart
Angels We were chosen
We do what must
What must be done
Michael The love is intermittent
The discipline continues
I work on your spirit
You work on my sinews.
Angels We work on his sinews
And the discipline continues
We have fun 'cause
We do what must
What must be done
Michael I watch myself from where you are
Please do not be mistaken
The spider web you see me through
Is the view I've always taken
Begin the ceremony now
That we have been preparing
I'm tired of this marble floor
That we have both been sharing.
Angels Now we will be sharing
What he has been preparing!
Girls He's the only one
He's the only one
He's the riddle of the music
He's the music of my life
Boys Now it begins
Now it begins
He's the riddle of the music
He's the music of the sacrifice
Will be done
Angels We work on his sinews
And the discipline continues
Everyone Begin the ceremony
Begin the sacrifice ...

Frank  Louis Are you still here? What are you waiting for?
Your lives to change? An oracle to speak?
Some version of the wounded matador
Who turns toward the bull his other cheek
And entertains you with a torn physique?
Some prisoner in pyjamas dancing lewd
Trablinka waltzes, while another freak
Hangs himself to concentrate your mood
And sweeten up your putrid solitude?
Michael My drummer is the only one I trust
Let the drums go rolling through the night
And let them pulverise my deep disgust
With steady thunder, whips and dynamite
The man of sticks and skins is always right.
I found him near the cremetorium
Humiliated, begging for a fight.
I wrote the name of honour on a drum
O drummer tell the people why I've come!
O listen to him and his saxophone
Frank  Louis Our musical genital unicorn
Michael He's very well hung with his golden horn
He'd like to be standing out here alone
The light on his hands, his mouth, and his bone.
Frank  Louis So take your solo now and loose your way
In every fingered hole and brassy groan...
You'll soon begin to choke on what you play
Michael You're choking now exactly as I say!
Michael, Frank As for the deeper spirits in the hall
 Louis Annointed ones and truely different
Whom orgy doesn't satisfy at all
Who loathe the horizontal argument
Frank  Louis It is to such as you that he was sent.
Michael I understand the loyalties that insist
You burn a child or shoot a president
Or tattoo numbers on a woman's wrist
I know the sorrow of the good idealist.
It is to such as you that I was sent
To speak directly to your deepest shame
And light the fires of experiment
And burn all hesitation in the flame 
I claim you now, I claim you in the name
Of that which you have never done before
And having done it never be the same.
The victim shall be smitten on his sore.
The haughty one shall have a visitor.
Michael, Frank We heard that drummer, do not think we missed
 Louis Your subtle derivation from the beat
Michael Which I established with an iron fist
A thousand years ago, a small deceit
To be enlarged until you have complete
Control of the mood and the atmosphere 
Your crooked time endangering my defeat 
Now all your instruments must disappear
And on your traitor's face pursue your

There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story long ago
She saw the Queen of Heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul
No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
That there were sorrows to be healed
And mercy, mercy in this world
So many hearts I find
Broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you
Won't you let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do
We've been, we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we moostly run
And every now and then we try
To mend the damage that we've done
Tonight, tonight I cannot rest
I've got this joy inside my breast
To think that I did not forget
That child, that song of Bernadette
So many hearts I find ...
Ah his fingernails, I see they're broken,
his ships they're all on fire.
The moneylender's lovely little daughter
ah, she's eaten, she's eaten with desire.
She spies him through the glasses
from the pawnshops of her wicked father.
She hails him with a microphone
that some poor singer, just like me, had to leave her.
She tempts him with a clarinet,
she waves a Nazi dagger.
She finds him lying in a heap
she wants to be his woman.
He says, "Yes, I might go to sleep
but kindly leave, leave the future,
leave it open."
He stands where it is steep,
oh I guess he thinks that he's the very first one,
his hand upon his leather belt now
like it was the wheel of some big ocean liner.
And she will learn to touch herself so well
as all the sails burn down like paper.
And he has lit the chain
of his famous cigarillo.
Ah, they'll never, they'll never ever reach the moon,
at least not the one that we're after
it's floating broken on the open sea, look out there, my friends,
and it carries no survivors.
But lets leave these lovers wondering
why they cannot have each other,
and let's sing another song, boys,
this one has grown old and bitter.
Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place for my head is bending low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place help me roll away the stone
Show me the place I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the Word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began
The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light a particle a wave
But there were chains so I hastened to behave
There were chains so I loved you like a slave
Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place for my head is bent and low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go
The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light a particle a wave
But there were chains so I hastened to behave
There were chains so I loved you like a slave
Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place help me roll away the stone
Show me the place I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the Word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began
It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
looking ate the Late Late show
through a semiprecious stone.
In the House of Honesty
her father was on trial,
in the House of Mystery
there was no one at all,
there was no one at all.
It seems so long ago,
none of us were strong
Nancy wore green stockings
and she slept with everyone.
She never said she'd wait for us
although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
in nineteen sixty one,
in nineteen sixty one.
It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
a forty five beside her head,
an open telephone.
We told her she was beautiful,
we told her she was free
but none of us would meet her in
the House of Mystery,
the House of Mystery.
And now you look around you,
see her everywhere,
many use her body,
many comb her hair.
In the hollow of the night
when you are cold and numb
you hear her talking freely then,
she's happy that you've come,
she's happy that you've come.
My father and all his tobacco loved you,
I love you too in all your forms,
the slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer,
the mean governess of the huge pink maps,
the solitary mourner of a prince.
I am cold and rainy,
I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station,
I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition,
I want ornaments on everything,
because my love, she gone with other boys.
do you have a punishment under the white lace,
will you be short with her, will you make her read those little Bibles,
will you spank her with a mechanical corset.
I want her pure as power, I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats
will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?
I'm not much nourished by modern love,
will you come into my life
with your sorrow and your black carriages,
And your perfect
the Twentieth Century belongs to you and me.
Let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership,
who discolour test tubes in the halls of Science,
who turn up unwelcome at every World's Fair,
heavy with proverbs and corrections,
confusing the stardazed tourists
with our incomparable sense of loss.
I saw Jesus on the cross on a hill called Calvary
"Do you hate mankind for what they done to you?"
He said, "Talk of love not hate, things to do  it's getting late.
I've so little time and I'm only passing through."
Passing through, passing through.
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
glad that I ran into you.
Tell the people that you saw me passing through.
I saw Adam leave the Garden with an apple in his hand,
I said "Now you're out, what are you going to do?"
"Plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through."
Passing through, passing through ...
I was with Washington at Valley Ford, shivering in the snow.
I said, "How come the men here suffer like they do?"
"Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
even though they know they're only passing through"

I was with Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
He said, "One world must come out of World War Two" ah, the fool
"Yankee, Russian, white or tan," he said, "A man is still a man.
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through."
Passing through, passing through ...
let's do it one more time
Passing through, passing through ...
I was walking in New York City and I brushed up against the man in front of me. I felt a cardboard placard on his back. And when we passed a streetlight, I could read it, it said "Please don't pass me by  I am blind, but you can see I've been blinded totally  Please don't pass me by." I was walking along 7th Avenue, when I came to 14th Street I saw on the corner curious mutilations of the human form it was a school for handicapped people. And there were cripples, and people in wheelchairs and crutches and it was snowing, and I got this sense that the whole city was singing this
Oh please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
And you know as I was walking I thought it was them who were singing it, I thought it was they who were singing it, I thought it was the other who was singing it, I thought it was someone else. But as I moved along I knew it was me, and that I was singing it to myself. It went
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
well, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
Oh please don't pass me by.
Now I know that you're sitting there deep in your velvet seats and you're thinking "Uh, he's up there saying something that he thinks about, but I'll never have to sing that song." But I promise you friends, that you're going to be singing this song it may not be tonight, it may not be tomorrow, but one day you'll be on your knees and I want you to know the words when the time comes. Because you're going to have to sing it to yourself, or to another, or to your brother. You're going to have to learn to sing this song, it goes
Please don't pass me by,
ah you don't have to sing this .. not for you.
Please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
Well I sing this for the Jews and the Gypsies and the smoke that they made. And I sing this for the children of England, their faces so grave. And I sing this for a saviour with no one to save. Hey, won't you be naked for me? Hey, won't you be naked for me? It goes
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Now there's nothing that I tell you that will help you connect the blood tortured night with the day that comes next. But I want it to hurt you, I want it to end. Oh, won't you be naked for me? Oh now
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Well I sing this song for you Blonde Beasts, I sing this song for you Venuses upon your shells on the foam of the sea. And I sing this for the freaks and the cripples, and the hunchback, and the burned, and the burning, and the maimed, and the broken, and the torn, and all of those that you talk about at the coffee tables, at the meetings, and the demonstrations, on the streets, in your music, in my songs. I mean the real ones that are burning, I mean the real ones that are burning
I say, Please don't pass me by,
oh now, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
ah now, I've been blinded totally,
oh no, please don't pass me by.
I know that you still think that its me. I know that you think that there's somebody else. I know that these words aren't yours. But I tell you friends that one day
You're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down ...
Oh, please don't pass me by,
oh, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well you know I have my songs and I have my poems. I have my book and I have the army, and sometimes I have your applause. I make some money, but you know what my friends, I'm still out there on the corner. I'm with the freaks, I'm with the hunted, I'm with the maimed, yes I'm with the torn, I'm with the down, I'm with the poor. Come on now ...
Ah, please don't pass me by,
well I've got to go now friends,
but, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
oh, I've been blinded, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Now I want to take away my dignity, yes take my dignity. My friends, take my dignity, take my form, take my style, take my honour, take my courage, take my time, take my time, .. time .. 'Cause you know I'm with you singing this song. And I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would go home with someone else. Wish you'd go home with someone else. I wish you'd go home with someone else. Don't be the person that you came with. Oh, don't be the person that you came with, Oh don't be the person that you came with. Ah, I'm not going to be. I can't stand him. I can't stand who I am. That's why I've got to get down on my knees. Because I can't make it by myself. I'm not by myself anymore because the man I was before he was a tyrant, he was a slave, he was in chains, he was broken and then he sang
Oh, please don't pass me by,
oh, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yes I am blind, Oh but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well I hope I see you out there on the corner. Yeah I hope as I go by that I hear you whisper with the breeze. Because I'm going to leave you now, I'm going to find me someone new. Find someone knew.
And please don't pass me by.

The walls of this hotel are paper thin
Last night I heard you making love to him
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb
The grunt of unity when he came in
I stood there with my ear against the wall
I was not seized by jealousy at all
In fact a burden lifted from my soul
I heard that love was out of my control
A heavy burden lifted from my soul
I learned that love was out of my control
I listened to your kisses at the door
I never heard the world so clear before
You ran your bath and you began to sing
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing
And I can't wait to tell you to your face
And I can't wait for you to take my place
You are the naked angel in my heart
You are the woman with her legs apart
It's written on the walls of this hotel
You go to heaven once you've been to hell
A heavy burden lifted from my soul
I heard that love was out of my control
All summer long she touched me
She gathered in my soul
From many a thorn, from many thickets
Her fingers, like a weaver's
Quick and cool
And the light came from her body
And the night went through her grace
All summer long she touched me
And I knew her, I knew her
Face to face
And her dress was blue and silver
And her words were few and small
She is the vessel of the whole wide world
Mistress, oh mistress, of us all
Dearly dead Queen of Solitude
I thank you with my heart
for keeping me so close to thee
while so many, oh so many, stood apart
And the light came from her body
And the night went through her grace
All summer long she touched me
I knew her, I knew her
Face to face
Some people say
It's what we deserve
For sins against gd
For crimes in the world
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
Since that day
They wounded New York
Some people say
They hate us of old
Our women unveiled
Our slaves and our gold
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
But answer me this
I won't take you to court
Did you go crazy
Or did you report
On that day
On that day
They wounded New York
I built my house beside the wood
So I could hear you singing
And it was sweet and it was good
And love was all beginning
Fare thee well my nightingale
'Twas long ago I found you
Now all your songs of beauty fail
The forest closes 'round you
The sun goes down behind a veil
'Tis now that you would call me
So rest in peace my nightingale
Beneath your branch of holly
Fare thee well my nightingale
I lived but to be near you
Tho' you are singing somewhere still
I can no longer hear you
It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
looking ate the Late Late show

Nancy wore green stockings
and she slept with everyone.
She never said she'd wait for us
although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
in nineteen sixty one,
in nineteen sixty one.
It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
a forty five beside her head,
an open telephone.
We told her she was beautiful,
we told her she was free
but none of us would meet her in
the House of Mystery,
the House of Mystery.
And now you look around you,
see her everywhere,
many use her body,
many comb her hair.
In the hollow of the night
when you are cold and numb
you hear her talking freely then,
she's happy that you've come,
she's happy that you've come.
I've been listening
to all the dissention.
I've been listening
to all the pain.
And I feel that no matter
what I do for you,
it's going to come back again.
But I think that I can heal it,
but I think that I can heal it,
I'm a fool, but I think I can heal it
with this song.
I've been listening
to all the dissention.
I've been listening
to all the pain.
And I feel that no matter
what I do for you,
it's going to come back again.
But I think that I can heal it,
but I think that I can heal it,
I'm a fool, but I think I can heal it
with this song.
Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see
I said "won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see
Your naked body?"
Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said "no you cannot see"
She said "no you cannot see
My naked body"
So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust Balloons
and paper streamers floating down on us
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body
from the album 'SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN'
I believe that you heard your master sing
when I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
that I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner wine and bread?
You met him at some temple, where
they take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
and he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
of all the kisses we put on some time before.
And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
with a collar of leather and nails,
and he never once made you explain or talk
about all of the little details,
such as who had a word and who had a rock,
and who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
and it never stops not even when your master fails.
And he took you up in his aeroplane,
which he flew without any hands,
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
that drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
and, an ape with angel glands,
erased the final wisps of pain
with the music of rubber bands.
And now I hear your master sing,
you kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
that your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
my body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
your shirt is all undone.
And will you kneel beside this bed
that we polished so long ago,
before your master chose instead
to make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
and you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
before he made you go.
Then I think you're playing far too rough
for a lady who's been to the moon
I've lain by this window long enough
to get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
who is tapping his foot to a tune,
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
let's say you came back some time too soon.
I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
and I taught him how you would long for me
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do.
I believe that you heard your master sing
while I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said,
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner wine and bread?
Sleep, baby, sleep
The day's on the run
The wind in the trees
Is talking in tongues
If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby
Well, the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now they've fallen in love
And they're talking in tongues
If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby
Sleep, baby, sleep
There's a morning to come
The wind and the trees
They're talking in tongues
If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby
The light came through the window,
Straight from the sun above,
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of Love.
In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see,
Out of which the Nameless makes
A Name for one like me.
I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.
All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.
I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.
Then I came back from where I'd been.
My room, it looked the same
But there was nothing left between
The Nameless and the Name.
All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.
I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then Love itself,
Love Itself was gone.
Love Itself was gone.
You thought that it could never happen
to all the people that you became,
your body lost in legend, the beast so very tame.
But here, right here,
between the birthmark and the stain,
between the ocean and your open vein,
between the snowman and the rain,
once again, once again,
love calls you by your name.
The women in your scrapbook
whom you still praise and blame,
you say they chained you to your fingernails
and you climb the halls of fame.
Oh but here, right here,
between the peanuts and the cage,
between the darkness and the stage,
between the hour and the age,
once again, once again,
love calls you by your name.
Shouldering your loneliness
like a gun that you will not learn to aim,
you stumble into this movie house,
then you climb, you climb into the frame.
Yes, and here, right here
between the moonlight and the lane,
between the tunnel and the train,
between the victim and his stain,
once again, once again,
love calls you by your name.
I leave the lady meditating
on the very love which I, I do not wish to claim,
I journey down the hundred steps,
but the street is still the very same.
And here, right here,
between the dancer and his cane,
between the sailboat and the drain,
between the newsreel and your tiny pain,
once again, once again,
love calls you by your name.
Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne?
Where are the paths your heroes came?
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away,
was I, was I only limping, was I really lame?
Oh here, come over here,
between the windmill and the grain,
between the sundial and the chain,
between the traitor and her pain,
once again, once again,
love calls you by your name.
She stands before you naked
you can see it, you can taste it,
and she comes to you light as the breeze.
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it,
it don't matter how you worship
as long as you're
down on your knees.
So I knelt there at the delta,
at the alpha and the omega,
at the cradle of the river and the seas.
And like a blessing come from heaven
for something like a second
I was healed and my heart
was at ease.
O baby I waited
so long for your kiss
for something to happen,
oh something like this.
And you're weak and you're harmless
and you're sleeping in your harness
and the wind going wild
in the trees,
and it ain't exactly prison
but you'll never be forgiven
for whatever you've done
with the keys.
O baby I waited ...
It's dark now and it's snowing
O my love I must be going,
The river has started to freeze.
And I'm sick of pretending
I'm broken from bending
I've lived too long on my knees.
Then she dances so graceful
and your heart's hard and hateful
and she's naked
but that's just a tease.
And you turn in disgust
from your hatred and from your love
and comes to you
light as the breeze.
O baby I waited ...
There's blood on every bracelet
you can see it, you can taste it,
and it's Please baby
please baby please.
And she says, Drink deeply, pilgrim
but don't forget there's still a woman
So I knelt there at the delta,
at the alpha and the omega,
I knelt there like one who believes.
And the blessings come from heaven
and for something like a second
I'm cured and my heart
is at ease.
Alas, my love, you did me wrong,
to cast me out discourteously,
for I have loved you so long,
delighting in your very company.
Now if you intend to show me disdain,
don't you know it all the more enraptures me,
for even so I still remain your lover in captivity.
Green sleeves, you're all alone,
the leaves have fallen, the men have gone.
Green sleeves, there's no one home,
not even the Lady Green Sleeves
I sang my songs, I told my lies,
to lie between your matchless thighs.
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild
to finally end our exercise
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn,
oh, I hoped you would be someone new.
I reached for you but you were gone,
so lady I'm going too.
Green sleeves, you're all alone ...
Green sleeves, you're all alone,
the leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home.
Green sleeves, it's so easily done,
leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.
The rain falls down on last year's man,
that's a jew's harp on the table,
that's a crayon in his hand.
And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
far past the stems of thumbtacks
that still throw shadows on the wood.
And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
and all the rain falls down amen
on the works of last year's man.
I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
oh one by one she had to tell them
that her name was Joan of Arc.
I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while
I want to thank you, Joan of Arc,
for treating me so well.
And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight
all these wounded boys you lie beside,
goodnight, my friends, goodnight.
I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived
Bethlehem the bridegroom,
Babylon the bride.
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me,
and Bethlehem inflamed us both
like the shy one at some orgy.
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
that I had to draw aside to see
the serpent eat its tail.
Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
so I hang upon my altar
and I hoist my axe again.
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
when Jesus was the honeymoon
and Cain was just the man.
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
that the wilderness is gathering
all its children back again.
The rain falls down on last year's man,
an hour has gone by
and he has not moved his hand.
But everything will happen if he only gives the word
the lovers will rise up
and the mountains touch the ground.
But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
and all the rain falls down amen
on the works of last year's man.
I came by myself to a very crowded place
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face.
I found her there but she was past all concern
I asked her to hold me, I said, "Lady, unfold me,"
but she scorned me and she told me
I was dead and I could never return.
Well, I argued all night like so many have before,
saying, "Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more."
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor,
she said, "Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me,
just win me or lose me,
it is this that the darkness is for."
I cried, "Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old,
the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold."
"If we cry now," she said, "it will just be ignored."
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning,
I could hear my lady calling,
"You've won me, you've won me, my lord,
you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord."
La la la la la la...
Now the flames they followe
d Joan of Arc
As she came riding through the dark
No moon to keep her armour bright,
And no man to get her through this dark, this very smoky night.
She said,  I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
With a wedding dress, something white
To wear upon swollen appetite.
La la la la la la...
Well I'm glad to..., to hear you talk this way,
You see I've watched you riding almost every single day
And there's something in me just yearns to win
Such a very cold and such a very lonesome heroine.
Well then, who are you?  she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm..., I'm fire,  he replied,
And I love your solitude, oh how I love your sense of pride.
La la la la la la...
Well then fire, make your body cold,
I'm gonna give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of our Joan of Arc,
And high above all of these assembled wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her very lovely wedding dress.
La la la la la la...
It was deep deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of our precious Joan of Arc,
Then she clearly, she clearly understood
If..., if he was fire, woah she must be wood.
I saw her wince, I saw her cry,
Saw the glory in her eye.
Myself I long..., I long for love and light,
But must it come so cruel, and must it..., must it be so very bright?
La la la la la la...
Can you tell me why the bells are ringing?
Nothing's happened in a million years
I've been sitting here since Wednesday morning
Wednesday morning can't believe my ears
Jazz police are looking through my folders
Jazz police are talking to my niece
Jazz police have got their final orders
Jazzer, drop your axe, it's Jazz police!
Jesus taken serious by the many
Jesus taken joyous by a few
Jazz police are paid by J.Paul Getty
Jazzers paid by J.Paul Getty II
Jazz police I hear you calling
Jazz police I feel so blue
Jazz police I think I'm falling,
I'm falling for you
Wild as any freedom loving racist
I applaud the actions of the chief
Tell me now oh beautiful and spacious
Am I in trouble with the Jazz police?
Jazz police are looking through my folders ...
They will never understand our culture
They'll never understand the Jazz police
Jazz police are working for my mother
Blood is thicker margarine than grease
Let me be somebody I admire
Let me be that muscle down the street
Stick another turtle on the fire
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat
Jazz police I hear you calling
Jazz police I feel so blue
Jazz police I think I'm falling,
I'm falling for you
If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner
Take my hand
Or if you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
I'm your man
If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man
Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please, please
I'm your man
And if you've got to sleep
A moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand
I'm your man
If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
It feels so good
And it feels so right
It feels like I've been rescued
In the middle of the night
And all the tricks and all the angels
And all the dirty rotten deals
They don't count now
They've been cancelled
And it feels, it just feels
Thank you Babe, thank you Babe
It feels so good
And it feels so right
It feels like I've been rescued
In the middle of the night
And the sweetest voice has spoken
And the deepest wound is healed
And the darkness is exploding
And it feels, it just feels
Thank you Babe, thank you Babe
It comes so sweet
And it comes so fast
It comes like windows breaking
I can take a breath at last
Thank you for the breaking
And thank you for the breath
And for sayin' it was nothing
Nothing meaning life or death
Thank you Babe… it just feels
You were the promise at dawn,
I was the morning after.
You were Jesus Christ my Lord,
I was the money lender.
You were the sensitive woman,
I was the very reverend Freud.
You were the manual orgasm,
I was the dirty little boy.
And is this what you wanted
to live in a house that is haunted
by the ghost of you and me?
Is this what you wanted ...
You were Marlon Brando,
I was Steve McQueen.
You were K.Y. Jelly,
I was Vaseline.
You were the father of modern medicine,
I was Mr. Clean.
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon,
I was Rin Tin Tin.
And is this what you wanted ...
And is this what you wanted ...
You got old and wrinkled,
I stayed seventeen.
You lusted after so many,
I lay here with one.
You defied your solitude,
I came through alone.
You said you could never love me,
I undid your gown.
And is this what you wanted ...
And is this what you wanted ...
I mean is this what you wanted ...
That's right, is this what you wanted ...
I needed you, I knew I was in danger
of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure,
You let me love you till I was a failure 
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine
I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, Don't worry, don't worry, darling
You said, Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time
You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, O sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine
Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine
Your sister fingers burned like iodine
And all my wanton lust was iodine
My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine
I saw you this morning.
You were moving so fast.
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past.
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight.
And we're still making love
In my secret life...
I smile when I'm angry.
I cheat and I lie.
I do what I have to do
To get by.
But I know what is wrong.
And I know what is right.
And I'd die for the truth
In my secret life...
Hold on, hold on, my brother.
My sister, hold on tight.
I finally got my orders.
I'll be marching through the morning,
Marching through the night,
Moving cross the borders
Of my secret life...
Looked through the paper.
Makes you want to cry.
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die.
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white.
Thank God it's not that simple
In my secret life...
I bite my lip.
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit,
To the wisdom of old.
But I'm always alone.
And my heart is like ice.
And it's crowded and cold
In my secret life...
If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner
Take my hand
Or if you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
I'm your man
If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man
Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please, please
I'm your man
And if you've got to sleep
A moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand
I'm your man
If you want a lover
I'll do anything that you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
I left a woman waiting
I met her sometime later
She said, I see your eyes are dead
What happened to you, lover?
What happened to you, my lover?
What happened to you, lover?
What happened to you?
And since she spoke the truth to me
I tried to answer truthfully
Whatever happened to my eyes
Happened to your beauty
Happened to your beauty
What happened to your beauty
Happened to me
We took ourselves to someone's bed
And there we fell together
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we
And free as running water
Free as running water
Free as running water
Free as you and me
The way it's got to be
The way it's got to be, lover
I stumbled out of bed
I got ready for the struggle
I smoked a cigarette
And I tightened up my gut
I said this can't be me
Must be my double
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what
I'm burning up the road
I'm heading down to Phoenix
I got this old address
Of someone that I knew
It was high and fine and free
Ah, you should have seen us
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember who
I'll be there today
With a big bouquet of cactus
I got this rig that runs on memories
And I promise, cross my heart,
They'll never catch us
But if they do, just tell them it was me
Yeah I loved you all my life
And that's how I want to end it
The summer's almost gone
The winter's tuning up
Yeah, the summer's gone
But a lot goes on forever
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what
Do you remember all of those pledges
That we pledged in the passionate night
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges
Like moths on a still yellow light
No penance serves to renew them
No massive transfusions of trust
Why not even revenge can undo them
So twisted these vows and so crushed
And you say you've been humbled in love
Cut down in your love
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one
Who kneels there as deeply as thee
Children have takes these pledges
They have ferried them out of the past
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges
Where love must go hiding at last
And here where there is no description
Oh here in the moment at hand
No sinner need rise up forgiven
No victim need limp to the stand
And you say you've been humbled in love...
And look dear heart, look at the virgin
Look how she welcomes him into her gown
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour
Dissolves like a star falling down
Why trade this vision for desire
When you may have them both
You will never see a man this naked
I will never hold a woman this close
And you say you've been humbled in love...
Your father's gone ahunting
He's deep in the forest so wild
And he cannot take his wife with him
He cannot take his child
Your father's gone ahunting
In the quicksand and the clay
And a woman cannot follow him
Although she knows the way
Your father's gone ahunting
Through the silver and the glass
Where only greed can enter
But spirit, spirit cannot pass
Your father's gone ahunting
For the beast we'll never cannot bind
And he leaves a baby sleeping
And his blessings all behind
Your father's gone ahunting
and he's lost his lucky charm
And he's lost the guardian heart
That keeps the hunter from the harm
Your father's gone ahunting
He asked me to say goodbye
And he warned me not to stop him
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try
Do you remember all of those pledges
That we pledged in the passionate night
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges
Like moths on a still yellow light
No penance serves to renew them
No massive transfusions of trust
Why not even revenge can undo them
So twisted these vows and so crushed
And you say you've been humbled in love
Cut down in your love
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one
Who kneels there as deeply as thee
Children have takes these pledges
They have ferried them out of the past
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges
Where love must go hiding at last
And here where there is no description
Oh here in the moment at hand
No sinner need rise up forgiven
No victim need limp to the stand
And you say you've been humbled in love...
And look dear heart, look at the virgin how she welcomes him into her gown
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour
Dissolves like a star falling down
Why trade this vision for desire
When you may have them both
You will never see a man this naked
I will never hold a woman this close
And you say you've been humbled in love...
from the album 'SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN'
I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,
yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new,
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you,
but now it's come to distances and both of us must try,
your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time,
walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,
it's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea,
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,
your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,
yes many loved before us, I know that we are not new,
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you,
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,
your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
Here is your crown
And your seal and rings
And here is your love
For all things.
Here is your cart,
And your cardboard and piss
And here is your love
For all of this.
May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.
Here is your wine,
And your drunken fall
And here is your love.
Your love for it all.
Here is your sickness.
Your bed and your pan
And here is your love
For the woman, the man.
May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.
And here is the night,
The night has begun
And here is your death
In the heart of your son.
And here is the dawn,
Until death do us part
And here is your death,
In your daughter's heart.
May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.
And here you are hurried,
And here you are gone
And here is the love,
That it's all built upon.
Here is your cross,
Your nails and your hill
And here is your love,
That lists where it will
May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king compsing Hallelujah
You faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke you throne
She cut your hair
And from you lips she drew the Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's its to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Now I've heard there was a secret chord

I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Now maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not complaint you hear tonight
And it's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
extremely uncertain transcription
The lady sounded ghostly in Gerrero,
She let me love her till I was a failure.
Her beauty on my bruise like iodine.
When I was weak enough to learn her methods,
I said "will I be punished for my crime?"
She said "there is a table set in heaven,
But I don't like to eat there all the time."
She pulled away the mask
Of the madonna,
She pulled away the mask tear
Of her thighs.
And never will
Until I should be screwin her last disguise.
And I was with her when there was no ocean.
Oh when there was no rules to spill the tides.
It only took of the wild imagination
To lay us in Guerrero side by side
She pulled away the mask
Of her madonna
She pulled away the mask tear
Of her thighs.
She couldn't find herself,
And never will,
Untill I should exhaust her last disguise.
And I was with her when there was no ocean.
When there was no blues to spill the tides.
Well long before the wild imagination,
To lay us in Guerrero side by side.
To lay us in Guerrero side by side.
I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit
But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube
Without my sorrow
To where it's better
Without my burden
Behind the curtain
Without the costume
That I wore
He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living with defeat
A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him to complete
I want to make him certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding
That is to say what I have told him
Without my sorrow
To where it's better
Without my burden
Behind the curtain
Without this costume
That I wore
I'm going home
Without my sorrow
To where it's better
Without my burden
Behind the curtain
Without this costume
That I wore
I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit
They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
For trying to change the system from within
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
But you see that line there moving through the station?
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those
Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I don't like your fashion business mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I'd really like to live beside you, baby ...
And I thank you for those items that you sent me
The monkey and the plywood violin
I practiced every night, now I'm ready
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
I am guided
Ah remember me, I used to live for music
Remember me, I brought your groceries in
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
Words by Lord Byron, music by Leonard Cohen
So we'll go no more aroving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more aroving
By the light of the moon.
They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom

I touched you once too often
Now I don't know who I am
My fingerprints were missing
When I wiped away the jam
Yes I called my fingerprints all night
But they don't seem to care
The last time that I saw them
They were leafing through your hair
Where are you now my fingerprints?
Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning
So I emptied out your drawer
A hundred thousand fingerprints
They floated to the floor
You know you hardly stopped to pick them up
You don't care what you lose
Ah you don't even seem to know
Whose fingerprints are whose
Where are you now my fingerprints?
And now you want to marry me
You want to take me down the aisle
You want to throw confetti fingerprints
You know that's not my style
O sure I'd like to marry you
But I can't face the dawn
With any girl who knew me
When my fingerprints were on
Where are you now my fingerprints?
Fingerprints, oh fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?
I touched you once too often
Now I don't know who I am
My fingerprints were missing
When I wiped away the jam
Yes I called my fingerprints all night
But they don't seem to care
The last time that I saw them
They were leafing through your hair
Where are you now my fingerprints?
Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning
So I emptied out your drawer
A hundred thousand fingerprints
They floated to the floor
You know you hardly stopped to pick them up
You don't care what you lose
Ah you don't even seem to know
Whose fingerprints are whose
Where are you now my fingerprints?
And now you want to marry me
You want to take me down the aisle
You want to throw confetti fingerprints
You know that's not my style

But I can't face the dawn

Where are you now my fingerprints?
Fingerprints, oh fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?
Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy.
Wounded in the line of duty,
parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties,
urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles.
Leave it all and like a man,
come back to nothing special,
such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,
silver bullet suicides,
and messianic ocean tides,
and racial rollercoaster rides
and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry.
I know you need your sleep now,
I know your life's been hard.
But many men are falling,
where you promised to stand guard.
I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor.
But then I overheard your prayer,
that you be this and nothing more
than just some grateful faithful woman's favourite singing millionaire,
the patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair,
working for the Yankee Dollar.
I know you need your sleep now ...
Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are,
and be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child.
Then let the other selves be ONE, yeah, let them manifest and come
till every taste is on the tongue,
till love is pierced and love is hung,
and every kind of freedom done, then oh,
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love,
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love.
Yes I remember the promise
That you made in the bar
When the kittens was born
And you could not keep warm
You moved away to a mountain
The sun rose behind
You said yourself a prayer
That you laid down on the blind
You lost them in your freedom,
You need 'em now you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child.
And the vow of compassion
That ya swore through your teeth
When the war began to end
And the little brown photographs weep
Nobody beleive it only
But as the train pulls away
With its cargo of folly
Sold as German paperweights
Costing you your freedom,
Even now you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child
do do do do   do do
do do do do
Well it's four in the morning
And there's no one at home
Except for your wife
And your little baby on the phone
Ah, somebody's gotta listen
To a promise or two
This room is far too small
For a pilgrim like you
They're offering you your freedom,
Yeah you need 'em now  you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child.
Ah, but now that you've decided
To follow the sun,
Like a shadow of waiting there
Or a king on the run
Your chains are too tight
For these seas you must swim.
You're smiling at the seaweed,
But your smile is much too grim.
Costing you your freedom, yeah,
Even now you're wild,
But blessed is the memory
Of eveybody's child
Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows that the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long stem rose
Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Ah give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
Ah when you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows
And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows
And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Oh everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Four o'clock in the afternoon
and I didn't feel like very much.
I said to myself, "Where are you golden boy,
where is your famous golden touch?"
I thought you knew where
all of the elephants lie down,
I thought you were the crown prince
of all the wheels in Ivory Town.
Just take a look at your body now,
there's nothing much to save
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries,
"Hey, Prince, you need a shave."
Now if you can manage to get
your trembling fingers to behave,
why don't you try unwrapping
a stainless steel razor blade?
That's right, it's come to this,
yes it's come to this,
and wasn't it a long way down,
wasn't it a strange way down?
There's no hot water
and the cold is running thin.
Well, what do you expect from
the kind of places you've been living in?
Don't drink from that cup,
it's all caked and cracked along the rim.
That's not the electric light, my friend,
that is your vision growing dim.
Cover up your face with soap, there,
now you're Santa Claus.
And you've got a gift for anyone
who will give you his applause.
I thought you were a racing man,
ah, but you couldn't take the pace.
That's a funeral in the mirror
and it's stopping at your face.
That's right, it's come to this,
yes it's come to this,
and wasn't it a long way down,
ah wasn't it a strange way down?
Once there was a path
and a girl with chestnut hair,
and you passed the summers
picking all of the berries that grew there
there were times she was a woman,
oh, there were times she was just a child,
and you held her in the shadows
where the raspberries grow wild.
And you climbed the twilight mountains
and you sang about the view,
and everywhere that you wandered
love seemed to go along with you.
That's a hard one to remember,
yes it makes you clench your fist.
And then the veins stand out like highways,
all along your wrist.
And yes it's come to this,
it's come to this,
and wasn't it a long way down,
wasn't it a strange way down?
You can still find a job,
go out and talk to a friend.
On the back of every magazine
there are those coupons you can send.
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians,
they can give you back your hope,
you can find your love with diagrams
on a plain brown envelope.
But you've used up all your coupons
except the one that seems
to be written on your wrist
along with several thousand dreams.
Now Santa Claus comes forward,
that's a razor in his mit
and he puts on his dark glasses
and he shows you where to hit
and then the cameras pan,
the stand in stunt man,
dress rehearsal rag,
it's just the dress rehearsal rag,
you know this dress rehearsal rag,
it's just a dress rehearsal rag.
I was born in a beauty salon
My father was a dresser of hair
My mother was a girl you could call on
When you called she was always there
When you called she was always there
When you called she was always there
When you called she was always there
When you called she was always there
Ah but don't go home with your hardon
It will only drive you insane
You can't shake it or break it with your Motown
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
I've looked behind all of the faces
That smile you down to you knees
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us
And when you try to they make you say Please
When you try to they make you say Please
When you try to they make you say Please
When you try to they make you say Please
When you try to they make you say Please
Ah but don't go home with your hardon ...
Here come's your bride with her veil on
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare
Approach her, you ape with your tail on
Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there
Ah but don't go home with your hardon ...
So I work in that same beauty salon
I'm chained to the old masquerade
The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone
I follow my father's trade
I follow my father's trade
Yes I follow my father's trade
Yes I follow my father's trade
Yes I follow my father's trade
Ah but don't go home with your hardon ...
It will only drive you insane
You can't shake it or break it with your Motown
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
I'm fortyone. The moon is full.
You make love very well.
You touch me like I touch myself.
I like you, mademoiselle.
You're so fresh and you're so new.
I do enjoy you, miss.
There's nothing I would rather do
Than move around just like this.
But do I have to dance all night?
Do I have to dance all night?
Oh tell me  bird of paradise,
Do I have to dance all night?
You never have to tell me what
It is you really think of me, alright.
Let's say I'm doing fine,
But do I have to dance all the night?
But do I have to dance all night?
But do I have to dance all night?
Ooh tell me Bird of Paradise,
Do I have to dance all night?
I learned this step awhile ago.
I had to practice it while everybody slept.
I waited half my life for you, you know.
I didn't even think that you'd accept.
And here you are before me in the flesh,
saying "yes, Yes,  YES!"
But do I have to dance all night?
Do I have to dance all night?
Come on, tell me,  Bird of Paradise,
Do I have to dance all night?
I learned this step awhile ago.
I had to practice it while everybody slept.
I waited half my life for you, you to know,
I never really thought that you'd accept.
And here you are before me in the flesh,
saying "yes, Yes,  YEAH..!"
 Come on now...
But do I have to dance all night?
Do I have to dance all night?
Oh tell me Bird of Paradise,
Do I have to dance all night?
We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live it is two
I to my side call the meek and the mild
You to your side call the Words
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I want to leave it alone
The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
Thus the ocean is crossed
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost
Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I want to leave it alone
Down in the valley the famine goes on
The famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldn't, you couldn't, you can't
You say that you must and you will
You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
Come on, baby, give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I want to leave it alone
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
But I want to leave it alone...
The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge,
man in white  that's you  says he has no friends.
The river is swollen up with rusty cans
and the trees are burning in your promised land.
And there are no letters in the mailbox,
and there are no grapes upon the vine,
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore,
and there are no diamonds in the mine.
Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb,
you say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him.
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night,
he was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight.
And there are no letters in the mailbox
and there are no grapes upon the vine,
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore,
and there are no diamonds in the mine.
You tell them now
Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch,
some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch,
and the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride,
he trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child.
And there are no letters in the mailbox,
oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine,
and there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore,
and there are no diamonds in your mine,
and there are no letters in the mailbox,
and there are no grapes upon the vine,
and there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore,
and there are no diamonds in your mine.
Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
"I never even knew how much I wanted you," she said.
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete.
"O baby, I have come too late." She knelt beside his feet.
"I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love."
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view
with a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
She said, "I'll make a place between my legs,
I'll show you solitude."
He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon
She took his much admired oriental frame of mind
and the heartofdarkness alibi his money hides behind
She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine 
"This mental space is occupied and everything is mine."
He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
She said, "The art of longing's over and it's never coming back."
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance,
she mocked his female fashions and his workingclass moustache.
The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
a woman's education but he's not a woman yet
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy
who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy.
So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed
it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.
I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
Drinking from your cup
I said "Is this contagious?"
You said "Just drink it up"
I've got no future
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too
I should have seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take the dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the prize
I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey, I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all
I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
I love the early morning
I pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness, baby
And I got it worse than you
I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
Drinking from your cup
I said "Is this contagious?"
You said "Just drink it up"
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
I had to go crazy to love you
Had to go down to the pit
Had to do time in the tower
Begging like crazy to quit
I had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone
Sometimes I'd head for the highway
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye
I had to go crazy to love you
Had to let everything fall
Had to be people I hated
Had to be no one at all
I'm tired of choosing desire
I've been saved by a blessed fatigue
The gates of commitment unwired
And nobody trying to leave
Sometimes I'd head for the highway
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye
Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone
Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you
Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you
And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you
There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you
Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend to give me
Comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you
Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
and the band is really happening
and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
she's the Angel of Compassion
she's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
lifts a happy face to thank her
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime
all the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polkadots
and it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
it's CLOSING TIME
Yeah the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polkadots
and it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
it's CLOSING TIME
Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
and the cider's laced with acid
and the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?"
And the moon is swimming naked
and the summer night is fragrant
with a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
down the snakes and up the ladder
to the tower where the blessed hours chime
and I swear it happened just like this
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
the Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
but CLOSING TIME
I swear it happened just like this
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
the Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
I loved you for your beauty
but that doesn't make a fool of me
you were in it for your beauty too
and I loved you for your body
there's a voice that sounds like God to me
declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
and I love you now there's nothing left
but sorrow and a sense of overtime
and I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it's something in between, I guess
it's CLOSING TIME
Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it's something in between, I guess
it's CLOSING TIME
Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
but there's nothing really happening
and the place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
gets me fumbling gets me laughing
she's a hundred but she's wearing
and I lift my glass to the Awful Truth
which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth
except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
we're busted in the blinding lights,
busted in the blinding lights
of CLOSING TIME
The whole damn place goes crazy twice
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
we're busted in the blinding lights,
busted in the blinding lights
of CLOSING TIME
Oh the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polkadots
It's CLOSING TIME
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's CLOSING TIME
I swear it happened just like this
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
It's CLOSING TIME
The Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But CLOSING TIME
I loved you when our love was blessed
I love you now there's nothing left
But CLOSING TIME
I miss you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.
O, gather up the brokenness
Bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises
You never dared to vow
The splinters that you carried
The cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind
And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb
Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
Of cruelty or the grace
O, solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind
O, see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart
O, troubledness concealing
An undivided love
The heart beneath is teaching
To the broken heart above
And let the heavens falter
Let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the altar
Come healing of the name
O, longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O, longing of the arteries
To purify the blood
And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb
O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
you were talking so brave and so sweet
giving me head on the unmade bed
while the limosines wait in the street.
Those were the reasons and that was New York
we were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
probably still is for those of them left.
Ah but you got away didn't you baby
you just turned your back on the crowd
You got away I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
and all of that jiving around.
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
you were famous you heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
but for me you would make an exception.
And clenching your fist for ones like us
who were oppresssed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself yourself you said never mind
we are ugly but we have the music.
And then you got away didn't you baby
you just turned you back on the crowd
You got away I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
and all of that jiving around.
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
that's all I don't think of you that often.
Artist Rufus Wainwright Lyrics
Song Chelsea Hotel No. 2 Lyrics
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
you were talking so brave and so sweet,
giving me head on the unmade bed,
while the limousines wait in the street.
Those were the reasons and that was New York,
we were running for the money and the flesh.
And that was called love for the workers in song
probably still is for those of them left.
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,
you just turned your back on the crowd,
you got away, I never once heard you say,
I need you, I don't need you,
I need you, I don't need you
and all of that jiving around.
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
you were famous, your heart was a legend.
You told me again you preferred handsome men
but for me you would make an exception.
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
you fixed yourself, and said, "Well never mind,
we are ugly but we have the music."
And then you got away, didn't you babe
you just turned your back on the crowd,
you got away, I never once heard you say,
I need you, I don't need you,
I need you, I don't need you
and all of that jiving around.
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
that's all, I don't even think of you that often.
By the rivers dark
I wandered on.
I lived my life
And I did forget
My holy song
And I had no strength
By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me.
And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark.
And he covered me,
And I saw within,
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring,
I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.
By the rivers dark
I panicked on.
I belonged at last
Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force,
And he said, This heart
It is not yours.'
And he gave the wind
My wedding ring
And he circled us
By the rivers dark,
In a wounded dawn,
I live my life
Though I take my song
From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him.
Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone,
If I forget
I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.
By the rivers dark,
Where it all goes on
By the rivers dark
O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought we'd meet.
You kiss my lips, and then it's done
I'm back on Boogie Street.
A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then it's time to go.
I tidied up the kitchenette
I tuned the old banjo.
I'm wanted at the trafficjam.
They're saving me a seat.
I'm what I am, and what I am,
Is back on Boogie Street.
And O my love, I still recall
The pleasures that we knew
The rivers and the waterfall,
Wherein I bathed with you.
Bewildered by your beauty there,
I'd kneel to dry your feet.
By such instructions you prepare
A man for Boogie Street.
O Crown of Light, O Darkened One...
So come, my friends, be not afraid.
We are so lightly here.
It is in love that we are made
In love we disappear.
Tho' all the maps of blood and flesh
Are posted on the door,
There's no one who has told us yet
What Boogie Street is for.
O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought we'd meet.
You kiss my lips, and then it's done
I'm back on Boogie Street.
A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then it's time to go . . .
My name is Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God.
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
And God is always angry
Just in case you think He's not
He's angry at your body
For reasons that are His
He doesn't like your body
According to reasons that are only His
I'd like you to know He's very very angry
But that's just the way He is
He's angry at the spirit
That is turned away from Him
He's angry at the spirit
That's turned away from Him
If He ever gets His Hands on it
He's gonna tear it limb from limb
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
And God is always angry
Just in case you think He's not
He drives him up the wall
I could say for a fact
He drives him up the wall
He's sorry that He ever thought of you and me at all
He1s angry when you're dying
And He's angry when you're dead
And you're always one or the other
He1s angry when you1re dying
And He's angry when you1re dead
And He's furious at me
For everything I've ever said
If you feel His anger some night
Let's say in a Motel room at three a.m.
If you feel His awesome anger
In your Hotel room let's say at three a.m.
It turns out that He's still very angry
That you took so long to be afraid of Him
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
I came here to tell you that God is always angry
Just in case you think He's not
If you fall asleep some night
Which everybody does
If you have the nerve to go to sleep one tired night
Which most everybody does
And you happen to have some silly dream
To Him it's very serious.
And if some lonely night you ask yourself
Where all the pretty girls are gone ?
Some night you're gonna ask yourself where where
Where are those pretty girls gone
Then He blows away the little scraps of paper
That they write their names and numbers on
Then you find that you get down on your knees
And you want to renounce for all time a woman's sweet caress
You have some vocation that makes you kneel down
And renounce for eternity a woman's sweet caress
Then He causes you do touch yourself
As soon as you undress
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
They call me Billy Sunday
I speak in the name of God
And God is always angry
Just in case you think He's not
Because of a few songs
Wherein I spoke of their mystery,
Women have been
to my old age.
They make a secret place
In their busy lives
And they take me there.
They become naked
In their different ways
and they say,
"Look at me, Leonard
Look at me one last time."
Then they bend over the bed
And cover me up
Like a baby that is shivering.
Are you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today
Oh that you're gonna need me?
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah.
Just be for real won't you, Baby
Be for real oh, Baby
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again
So you see I'm not naive.
I just would like to believe
Ah what you tell me.
So don't give me the world today
And tomorrow take it away.
Don't do that to me, darling.
Just be for real won't you, Baby
Be for real won't you, Baby
Been hurt so many times see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again.
I don't give a damn about the truth, Baby
Except for the naked truth. Oh yeah
Just be for real won't you, Baby
Be for real won't you, Baby
No, no, no, no
It's just that I, I don't want to be hurt by love again.
Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.
There's something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me
There's something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me
It's a broken benjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea
It's a broken benjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea
Don't know how it got there
Maybe taken by the wave
Don't know how it got there
Probably taken by the wave
Of the someones shoulder
Or out of someones grave
Of the someones shoulder
Or of the someones grave
It's coming for me, darling
No matter where I go
It's coming for me darling
No matter where I go
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know
There is something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me
There is something that I'm watching
Means a lot to me
It's a broken benjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea
It's a broken benjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea
Say a prayer for the cowboy
His mare's run away
And he'll walk til he finds her
His darling, his stray
but the river's in flood
and the roads are awash
and the bridges break up
in the panic of loss.
And there's nothing to follow
There's nowhere to go
She's gone like the summer
gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking
his heart with their song
as the day caves in
and the night is all wrong
Did he dream, was it she
who went galloping past
and bent down the fern
broke open the grass
and printed the mud with
the iron and the gold
that he nailed to her feet
when he was the lord
And although she goes grazing
a minute away
he tracks her all night
he tracks her all day
Oh blind to her presence
except to compare
his injury here
with her punishment there
Then at home on a branch
in the highest tree
a songbird sings out
Ah the sun is warm
and the soft winds ride
on the willow trees
by the river side
Oh the world is sweet
the world is wide
and she's there where
the light and the darkness divide
and the steam's coming off her
she's huge and she's shy
and she steps on the moon
when she paws at the sky
And she comes to his hand
but she's not really tame
She longs to be lost
he longs for the same
and she'll bolt and she'll plunge
through the first open pass
to roll and to feed
in the sweet mountain grass
Or she'll make a break
for the high plateau
where there's nothing above
and there's nothing below
and it's time for the burden
it's time for the whip
Will she walk through the flame
Can he shoot from the hip
So he binds himself
to the galloping mare
and she binds herself
to the rider there
and there is no space
but there's left and right
and there is no time
but there's day and night
And he leans on her neck
and he whispers low
"Whither thou goest
I will go"
And they turn as one
and they head for the plain
No need for the whip
Ah, no need for the rein
Now the clasp of this union
who fastens it tight?
Who snaps it asunder
the very next night
Some say the rider
Some say the mare
Or that love's like the smoke
beyond all repair
But my darling says
"Leonard, just let it go by
That old silhouette
on the great western sky"
So I pick out a tune
and they move right along
and they're gone like the smoke
and they're gone like this song
You know it really is a pity, the way you treat me now
I know you can't forgive me but forgive me, anyhow.
The ending got so ugly, I even heard you say,
"You never ever loved me but could you love me anyway?"
I dreamed about you, baby, you were wearin' half your dress
I know you have to hate me but could you hate me less?
I've used up all my chances and you'll never take me back
But there ain't no harm in askin', "Could you cut me one more slice?"
I'm naked and I'm filthy and there's sweat upon my brow
And both of us are guilty, anyhow.
Have mercy on me, baby. After all, I did confess,
Even though you have to hate me, could you hate me less?
It's a shame and it's a pity
I know you can forgive me
The ending got so ugly
You never ever loved me
Dreamed about you, baby
I know you have to hate me
I'm naked and I'm filthy
Both of us are guilty
Have mercy on me, baby
Oh friends, .. don't matter if you're a man or a woman. If you're in love
with somebody, these are the words that you got to learn to say. Now
listen carefully. Here it comes...
I'll be loving you always
with a love that's true, always
When the thing you've planned
needs my helping hand,
I will understand, always, always
Days may not be fair, always
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour,
Not for just a day,
Not for just a year, but always.
I said that I'll be loving you, always
with a love that's true, always.
When the thing you've planned
needs my helping hand,
I will, I will understand, always, always
Oh that's pretty ... that's pretty too ... Oh darling
The days may not be fair, always
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always
Not for just a second, or a minute, or an hour,
Not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower,
Not for just the summer and the winter going sour,
But always, always, always
Ok if you don't want to quit, let's try it one more time
I'll be loving you, always
with a love that's true, always.
When the thing you've planned
needs my helping hand,
I will understand, I will, I will understand, always, always
The days may not be fair, always
Don't worry, baby
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour,
Not for just a day,
Not for just a year, but always.
Tell me again when I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
Tell me again we're alone and I'm listening
Listening so hard that it hurts
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll want me then
Tell me again when the victims are singing
And the laws of remorse are restored
Tell me again that you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the lord
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll love me then
Tell me again when the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin
Try me again when the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll need me then
Tell me again when the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again when the rest of the culture
Has passed through the eye of the camp
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll love me then
By Irving Berlin

Suddenly the night has grown colder.
The god of love preparing to depart.
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart.
Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure,
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine.
It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving,
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this.
As someone long prepared for this to happen,
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in.
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing.
Your firm commitments tangible again.
And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord.
Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this.
As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect.
And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
I loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
And I can't believe that time's
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love.
I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I need to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
And I'll never get enough
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
There ain't no drink no drug
Ah tell them, angels
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love
I see you in the subwayand I see you on the bus
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
I see your hand, I see your hair
Your bracelets and your brush
And I call to you, I call to you
But I don't call soft enough
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love
I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
It's written in the scriptures
It's written there in blood
I even heard the angels declare it from above
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure,
That cure for love
The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odds are there to beat.
You win a while, and then it's done
Your little winning streak.
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat,
You live your life as if it's real,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,
I'm back on Boogie Street.
You lose your grip, and then you slip
Into the Masterpiece.
And maybe I had miles to drive,
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.
And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.
Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me.
I made it to the forward deck.
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,
I'm back on Boogie Street.
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep.
And quiet is the thought of you,
The file on you complete,
Except what we forgot to do,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.
And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.
The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odds are there to beat . . .
Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess.
Is it true you betrayed us? The answer is Yes.
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine,
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline.
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice,
a singer must die for the lie in his voice.
And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty,
you keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty.
Your vision is right, my vision is wrong,
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song.
Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid
in the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive,
in the rings of her silk, in the hinge of her thighs,
where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise.
Oh goodnight, goodnight, my night after night,
my night after night, after night, after night, after night, after night.
I am so afraid that I listen to you,
your sun glassed protectors they do that to you.
It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace,
their knee in your balls and their fist in your face.
Yes and long live the state by whoever it's made,
sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late.
I can see it in your eyes
Even though you tried to hide
You ain't getting all you need
Girl you need security
You don't hear a word I'm saying
Cause you feel you understand him
Tell me if I'm out of line
But I think I got things right
You need a man like me anything that you need
You need a man like me I will never let you down
You need a man like me Anything that you want
You need a man like me I will never mess around
You don't need to suffer in silence
You don't have to grieve in vain
But still you carry on
Even though you're feeling pain
I know he needs you're love
I know he needs you to care
But love is a two way thing
And girl you don't need him
I'm gonna take you down
Deep down, to the front line
You woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun,
Mama always said you'd be
The Chosen One.
She said You're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine,
But you were born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.
When you woke up this morning
All that love had gone,
Your Papa never told you
About right and wrong.
But you're looking good, baby,
I believe that you're a feeling fine,shame about it,
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes.
So sing it now
Woke up this morning
Got a blue moon
Got a blue moon in your eyes
God damned shame about it
You woke up this morning
The world turned upside down, Lord above,
Thing's ain't been the same
Since the Blues walked into town.
But you're one in a million
You've got that shotgun shine. shame about it,
Born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.
When you woke up this morning everything was gone.
By half past ten your head was going dingdong.
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should
know. Last night you were flying but today you're so low
 ain't it times like these that make you wonder if
you'll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to
the others wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you
didn't think beyond the next paycheck and the next little
Well you do so make up your mind to go on, ?cos
when you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
You want to be,
You want to be the Chosen One.
Yeah, you know it.
Just can't help yourself, yeah.
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun
It feels so good
And it feels so right
It feels like I've been rescued
In the middle of the night
And all the tricks and all the angels
And all the dirty rotten deals
They don't count now
They've been cancelled
And it feels, it just feels
Thank you Babe, thank you Babe
It feels so good
And it feels so right
It feels like I've been rescued
In the middle of the night
And the sweetest voice has spoken
And the deepest wound is healed
And the darkness is exploding
And it feels, it just feels
Thank you Babe, thank you Babe
It comes so sweet
And it comes so fast
It comes like windows breaking
I can take a breath at last
Thank you for the breaking
And thank you for the breath
And for sayin' it was nothing
Nothing meaning life or death
Thank you Babe… it just feels
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king compsing Hallelujah
You faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke you throne
She cut your hair
And from you lips she drew the Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's its to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
You Have the Lovers
You have the lovers,
they are nameless, their histories only for each other,
and you have the room, the bed, and the windows.
Pretend it is a ritual.
Unfurl the bed, bury the lovers, blacken the windows,
let them live in that house for a generation or two.
No one dares disturb them.
Visitors in the corridor tiptoe past the long closed door,
they listen for sounds, for a moan, for a song
nothing is heard, not even breathing.
You know they are not dead,
you can feel the presence of their intense love.
Your children grow up, they leave you,
they have become soldiers and riders.
Your mate dies after a life of service.
Who knows you? Who remembers you?
But in your house a ritual is in progress
It is not finished it needs more people.
One day the door is opened to the lover's chamber.
The room has become a dense garden,
full of colours, smells, sounds you have never known.
The bed is smooth as a wafer of sunlight,
in the midst of the garden it stands alone.
In the bed the lovers, slowly and deliberately and silently,
perform the act of love.
Their eyes are closed,
as tightly as if heavy coins of flesh lay on them.
Their lips are bruised with new and old bruises.
Her hair and his beard are hopelessly tangled.
When he puts his mouth against her shoulder
she is uncertain whether her shoulder
has given or received the kiss.
All her flesh is like a mouth.
He carries his fingers along her waist
and feels his own waist caressed.
She holds him closer and his own arms tighten around her.
She kisses the hand besider her mouth.
It is his hand or her hand, it hardly matters,
there are so many more kisses.
You stand beside the bed, weeping with happiness,
you carefully peel away the sheets
from the slowmoving bodies.
Your eyes filled with tears, you barely make out the lovers,
As you undress you sing out, and your voice is magnificent
because now you believe it is the first human voice
heard in that room.
The garments you let fall grow into vines.
You climb into bed and recover the flesh.
You close your eyes and allow them to be sewn shut.
You create an embrace and fall into it.
There is only one moment of pain or doubt
as you wonder how many multitudes are lying beside your body,
but a mouth kisses and a hand soothes the moment away.
Last night I lay trembling
The moon it was low
It was the end of love
Of misery and woe
The suddenly above me
Her face buried in light
Came a vision of beauty
All covered in white
Now the belltower is ringing
And the night has stole past
O Lucy, can you hear me?
Wherever you rest
I'll love her forever
I'll love her for all time
I'll love her till the stars
Fall down from the sky
Now the belltower is ringing
And I shake on the floor
O Lucy, can you hear me?
When I call and call
Now the belltower is ringing
And the moon it is high
O Lucy, can you hear me
When I cry and cry and cry
I am a crooked man
And I've walked a crooked mile
Night, the shameless widow
Doffed her weeds, in a pile
The stars all winked at me
They shamed a child
Your funeral, my trial
A thousand Marys lured me
To feathered beds and fields of glover
Bird with crooked wing cast
It's wicked shadow over
A bauble moon did mock
And trinket stars did smile
Your funeral, my trial
Here I am, little lamb...
Let all the bells in whoredom ring
All the crooked bitches that she was
Mongers of pain
Saw the moon
Become a fang
Your funeral, my trial
Come in, babe
Across these purple fields
The sun has sunk behind you
Across these purple fields
That idiotboy in the corner
Is speaking deviated truths
Come on, admit it, babe
It's a wonderful life
If you can find it
If you can find it
If you can find it
It's a wonderful life that you bring
Ooh it's a wonderful thing
Speak our secret into your hands
And hold it in between
Plunge your hands into the water
And drown it in the sea
There will be nothing between us, baby
But the air that we breathe
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
If you can find it
If you can find it
If you can find it
It's a wonderful life that you bring
It's a wonderful, wonderful thing
We can build our dungeons in the air
And sit and cry the blues
We can stomp across this world
With nails hammered through our shoes
Who criticise and accuse
It don't matter much
We got nothing much to lose
But this wonderful life
If you can find it
And when you find it
And when you find it
It's a wonderful life that you bring
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful thing
Sometimes our secrets are all we've got
With our lives we must defend
Sometimes the air between us, babe
Is unbearably thin
Sometimes it's wise to lay down your gloves
And just give in
Come in, come in
Come in, come in
To this wonderful life
If you can find it
And if you find it
It's a wonderful life that you bring
It's a wonderful, wonderful thing
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
Weell, ah've spent seven days and seven nights
tryin to get sunk in this brine
Don't turn on ya waterworks
'cause ah got me a pair of waterwings, right?!
Insects suicide against the window,
and my heart goes out to those lil flies
There's a buggin in my ear
but it's more of her blackmail, ham shakespeare + her
Wings off Flies, She loves me, she loves me not.
O o o o oh she loves me not!!
Lord, Ah've discovered the recipe of Heaven
ya git solitude and mix with sanctuary and silence,
then bake it!
Listen, I plead guilty to misanthropy
so hang me! Ah'd appreciate it!!
Witness her gatecrash my tiny hell
with some obscene tetealete,
If ya wanna talk to me about Love'n'Pain
consult my ulcer, A'd be happy to cooperate
Wings off Flies, she loves me, loves me not
Ey, Joe! another outa do the job.
Time to drown our lil fire, ya can keep the ashes,
Now bye bye, bye, bye, see ya in a pigs eye!
Ah will be one, in need of noone
In this, my deepest dive...
Filler up, Joe...
Hey! Ah am obliged! Ah am olbiged!
Wings off Flies, She loves me, she loves me not
Wings off Flies etc... ad infinitum

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"
On the second day he came with a single red rose
Said "Will you give me your loss and your sorrow"
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
He said, "If I show you the roses, will you follow?"
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth
I remember a girl so very well
The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell
O where do we go now but nowhere
In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun
And then we fucked it down again
Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down
Going round and round to nowhere
The kitten that padded and purred on my lap
Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that
O where do we go now but nowhere
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
Across clinical benches with nothing to talk
Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer
While the bones of our child crumble like chalk
O where do we go now but nowhere
I remember a girl so bold and so bright
Looselimbed and laughing and brazen and bare
Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light
O where do we go now but nowhere
You come for me now with a cake that you've made
Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades
O where do we go now but nowhere
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home
From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air
Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans
O where do we go now but nowhere
Around the duck pond we grimly mope
Gloomily and mournfully we go rounds again
And one more doomed time and without much hope
Going round and around to nowhere
From the balcony we watched the carnival band
The crack of the drum a little child did scare
I can still feel his tiny fingers pressed in my hand
O where do we go now but nowhere
If I could relive one day of my life
If I could relive just a single one
You on the balcony, my future wife
O who could have known, but no one
O wake up, my love, my lover make up
O wake up, my love, my lover make up
When I first came to town
All the people gathered round
They bought me drinks
Lord, how they quickly changed their tune
When I first came to town
People took me round from end to end
Like someone may take round a friend
O how quickly they changed their tune
Suspicion and dark murmurs surround me
Everywhere I go they confound me
As though the blood on my hands
Is there for every citizen to see
O sweet Jesus
There is no turning back
There is always one more town
A little further down the track
And from my window, across the tracks
I watch the juicers burn their fires
And in that light
Their faces leer at me
How I wish they'd just let me be
When I first came to town
Their favours were for free
Now even the doors of the whores of this town
Are closed to me
I search the mirror
And I try to see
Why the people of this town
Have washed their hands of me
O sweet Jesus
There is no turning back
There is always one more town
A little further down the track
O lord, every goddamn turn I take
I fear the noose, I fear the stake
For there is no bone
They did not break
In all the towns I've been before
Well those that sin against me are snuffed out
I know from every day that I live
Goddamn the day that I was born
The night that forced me from the womb
And goddamn this town
For I am leaving now
But one day I will return
And the people of this town will surely see
Just how quickly the tables turn
O sweet Jesus
This really is the end
There is always one more town
A little further round the end
With a crooked smile and a heartshaped face
Comes from the West country where the birds sing bass
She's got a housebig heart where we all live
And plead and council and forgive
Her widow's peak, her lips I've kissed
Her glove of bones at her wrist
That I have held in my hand
Her Spanish fly and her monkey gland
Her Godly body and its fourteen stations
That I have embraced, her palpitations
Her unborn baby crying, "Mummy"
Amongst the rubble of her body
Her lovely lidded eyes I've sipped
Her fingernails, all pink and chipped
Her accent which I'm told is "broad"
That I have heard and has been poured
Into my human heart and filled me
With love, up to the brim, and killed me
And rebuilt me back anew
With something to look forward to
Well, who could ask much more than that?
A West country girl with a big fat cat
That looks into her eyes of green
And meows, "He loves you", then meows again
Along crags and sunless cracks I go
Up rib of rock, donw spine of stone
I dare not slumber where the right winds whistle
Lest her creepingsoul clutch this heart of thistle
O the same God that abandon'd her
Has in turn abandon'd me
And softenin' the turf with with my tears
I dug a Well of Misery
And, in that Well of Misery
Hangs a bucket fulla Sorrow
Which swings slow an' achin' like a bell
Its toll is dead and hollow
Down that well lies the longlost dress
of my lil floatin girl
That muffles a tear that you let fall
All down that Well of Misery
Put ya shoulder to the handle, if ya dare
and hoist that bucket, hither
Till ya muscles waste'n'wither
O the same God that abandon'd her
Has in turn abandon'd me
Deep in the Desert of Despair
I wait at the Well of Misery
I left by the back door
With my wife's lover's smoking gun
I don't know what I was hoping for
I hit the road at a run
I was your lover
I was your man
There never was no other
I was your friend
Till we came along this road
Till we came along this road
Till we came along this road
I ain't sent you no letters, Ma
But I'm looking quite a trip
The world spinning beneath me, Ma
Guns blazing at my hip
You were my lover
You were my friend
There never was no other
On whom I could depend
Then we came along this road
We came along this road
We came along this road
What we once thought we had we didn't, and what we have now will never be that way again
So we call upon the author to explain
Our myxomatoid kids spraddle the streets, we've shunned them from the greasygrind
The poor little things, they look so sad and old as they mount us from behind
I ask them to desist and to refrain
And then we call upon the author to explain
Rosary clutched in his hand, he died with tubes up his nose
And a cabal of angels with finger cymbals chanted his name in code
We shook our fists at the punishing rain
And we call upon the author to explain
He said everything is messed up around here, everything is banal and jejune
There is a planetary conspiracy against the likes of you and me in this idiot constituency of the moon
Well, he knew exactly who to blame
And we call upon the author to explain
Prolix! Prolix! Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix!
Prolix! Prolix! Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix!
Well, I go guruing down the street, young people gather round my feet
Ask me things, but I don'r know where to start
They ignite the powertrail ssstraight to my father's heart
And once again I call upon the author to explain
We call upon the author to explain
Who is this great burdensome slavering dogthing that mediocres my every thought?
I feel like a vacuum cleaner, a complete sucker, it's fucked up and he is a fucker
But what an enormous and encyclopaedic brain
I call upon the author to explain
Oh rampant discrimination, mass poverty, third world debt, infectious diseease
Global inequality and deepening socioeconomic divisions
Well, it does in your brain
And we call upon the author to explain
Now hang on, my friend Doug is tapping on the window Hey Doug, how you been?
Brings me back a book on holocaust poetry complete with pictures
Then tells me to get ready for the rain
And we call upon the author to explain
I say prolix! Prolix! Something a pair of scissors can fix
Bukowski was a jerk! Berryman was best!
He wrote like wet papier mache, went the Hemingway weirdly on wings and with maximum pain
We call upon the author to explain
Down in my bolthole I see they've published another volume of unreconstructed rubbish
"The waves, the waves were soldiers moving". Well, thank you, thank you, thank you
And again I call upon the author to explain
Yeah, we call upon the author to explain
Prolix! Prolix! There's nothing a pair of scissors can't fix!
It is morning
She is yawning
As she walks about the room
Her hair falls down her breast
She is naked and it is June
Standing at the window
I wonder if she knows that I can see
Watching Alice rise year after year
Up in her palace, she's captive there
Is golden brown
Her hair hangs down
As she stoops to conquer me
First she pulls her stocking on
And then the church bell chimes
Alice climbes into her uniform
The zippers on the side
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's cruel
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's true
I'm a wanted man, wanted man...
I'm wanted, I'm a wanted man...
ah honey, I'm a wanted man.
I'm a wanted man in California, I'm a wanted man in Buffalo
I'm a wanted man in Kansas City, I'm a wanted man in Ohio
I'm a wanted man in Mississippi, They want me in old Cheyenne
Wherever you may look tonight, you will see this wanted man.
I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea,
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be.
If you ever see me comin' and you know justa who I am,
Don't breathe a word to no one buddy, 'cause I'm a wanted man.
Wanted man in Albuquerque, wanted man in Syracuse,
Wanted man in Tallahassee, wanted man in Baton Rouge,
Wanted man in Arizona, wanted man in Galveston,
Wanted man in El Dorado, this wanted man's in great demand.
If you ever catch me sleepin',

Wanted man by Lucy Watson, wanted man by Jesse Brown,
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson, wanted man in this next town.
Wanted man by the Boller? Sisters,
wanted man by Kid Callahan.
Hey Darlin' don't you tell me you don't want me,
cause I'm a wanted man.
A wanted man who's lost his will to live,
a wanted man who won't lay down,
There's a woman kneelin' on my grave,
pushin' daisies in the ground.
Wanted man in the Windy City, wanted man in Tennessee,
Wanted man in Broken Arrow, wanted man in Wounded Knee.
Wanted man in Jackson Town, Wanted man in El Passo,
I got bounties on my head in towns I wouldn't ever think to go.
Wanted Man in Arizona, wanted man in Louisville,
Wanted man deep in Death Valley,
wanted man up in the Hollywood Hill.
If the Devil comes collectin',
cause he doesn't know I'm a wanted man,
he'd better wear a six gun on his hip
and hold another in his hand.
If you love the wanted man,
you best hold him while you can,
cause you're gonna wake up one mornin'
and find the man you wanted, he is gone.
Wanted man in New York City, wanted man in San Anton'
Wanted man down in Lorado, wanted man in Tupelo
Wanted man in the state of Texas, wanted man in the state of Maine
This wanted man's in the state of leavin' ya baby,
jumpin' on a midnight train.
Wanted man in every cat house, wanted man in a many saloons,
Wanted man is a ghost in hundred homes, a shadow in a thousand rooms.
Wanted man down in St. Louis, wanted man in New Orleans
Wanted man in Mussel? Bay, wanted man in Cripple Creek
Wanted man in Detriot City, wanted man in San Anton'
But there's one place I'm not wanted lord,
it's the place that I call home.
If the devil comes collectin'
he better hold a six gun in his hand.
O My O My
What a wretched life
I was born on the day
That my poor mother died
I was cut from her belly
With a stanley knife
My daddy did a jig
With the drunk midwife
Who's that younder all in flames
Dragging behind him a sack of chains
Who's that younder all in flames
Up jumped the Devil and he staked his claim
O poor heart
I was doomed from the start
Doomed to play
The villians part
I was the baddest Johnny
In the apple cart
My blood was blacker
Than the of a dead nun's heart
Who's that milling on the courthouse steps
Nailing my face to the hitching fence
Who's that milling on the courthouse steps
Up jumped the Devil and off he crept
O no O no
Where could I go
With my hump of trouble
And my sack of woe
To the digs and deserts of Mexico
Where my neck was safe from the lynching rope
Who's that younder laughing at me
Like I was the brunt of some hilarity
Who's that younder laughing at me
Up jumped the Devil 1, 2, 3
HaHa Ha Ha
How lucky we were
We hit the cathouse
And sampled their whares
We got as drunk
As a couple of Czars
One night I spat out
My lucky stars
Who's that dancing on the jailhouse roof
Stamping on the ramping with a cloven hoof
Who's that dancing on the jailhouse roof
Up jumped the Devil and said "Here is your man and I got a proof"
O no don't go O no
O slow down Joe
The righteous part
I straight as an arrow
Take a walk
And you'll find it too narrow
Too narrow for the likes of me
Who's that hanging from the gallow tree
His eyes are hollow but he looks like me
Who's that swinging from the gallow tree
Up jumped the Devil and took my soul from me
Down we go Down we go Down we go
The Devil and me Down we go down down down
Hell fire and flames Down we go Down we go
To Eternity Down we go We go down down down
Down we go we go down down down
Down we go the Devil and me to Eternity

Blow shorty back out till she had to crawl out crawl out
Looka yonder! Looka yonder!
Looka yonder! A big black cloud come!
O comes to Tupelo. Comes to Tupelo.
Yonder on the horizon.
Stopped at the mighty river and
Sucked the damn thing dry.
Tupelooo, O Tupelo.
In a valley hides a town called Tupelo.
Distant thunder rumble. Rumble hungry like the Beast.
The Beast it cometh. Cometh down. Wo wo wooo.
Tupelo bound. Tupelooo. Yeah Tupelo.
The Beast it cometh. Tupelo bound.
Why the hen won't lay no egg.

O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!
Ya can say these streets are rivers.
Ya can call these rivers streets.
Ya can tell ya self ya dreaming buddy.
But no sleep runs this deep.
No! No sleep runs this deep.
Women at their windows
Rain crashing on the pane
Writing in the frost
Tupelos' shame. Tupelo's shame.
O God help Tupelo! O God help Tupelo!
O go to sleep lil children
The sandmans on his way.
O go to sleep lil children.
The sandmans in his way.
But the lil children know
They listen to the beating of their blood.
They listen to the beating of their blood.
The sandman's mud!
The sandman's mud!
And the black rain come down.
Water water everywhere.
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim.
No fish can swim
Until The King is born!
Until The King is born!
In Tupelo! Tupelooo!
Til The King is born in Tupelo!
In a clapboard shack with a roof of tin.
Where the rain came down and leaked within.
A young mother frozen on a concrete floor.
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw.
Tupelooo! O Tupelo!
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw.
Well Saturday gives what Sunday steals.
And a child is born on his brothers heels.
Come Sunday morn the firstborn dead.
In a shoebox tied with a ribbon of red.
Tupelooo! Hey Tupelo!
In a shoebox tied with a ribbon of red.

You will reap just what you sow.
In the name of pain!
In the name of pain and suffering
In the name of pain!
In the name of pain and suffering
There comes a train!
There comes a train
A long black train
There comes a train
Lord, a long black train.
Punched from the tunnel
The tunnel of love is long and lonely
Engines steaming like a fist
A fistful of memories
Into the jolly jaw of morning
Yeah! O yeah!
O baby it gets smashed!
You know that it gets smashed
I kick every goddamn splinter
Into all the looking eyes in the world
Into all the laughing eyes
Of all the girls in the world
She ain't never comin back.
She ain't never comin back.
She ain't never comin back.
She ain't never comin back.
And the name of the pain is...
And the name of the pain is...
The name of the pain is
A train longsuffering
On rails of pain
On rails of pain and suffering
There comes a train

On rails of pain
On rails of pain and suffering

Little Janie, she wakes up from a dream
A gun like a jawbone down the waistband of her jeans
Mr Sandman, he can recite today's lesson in his sleep
He says there oughta be some kind of law against me going down the street
And little Janie pipes up and she says
She says we're gonna have a real cool time tonight
Down the back of Janie's jeans she had the jawbone of an ass
Mr Sandman, he runs around the corner
Trying to head her off at the pass
He sticks his head over the fence and yells something way too fast
It's today's lesson, yeah, something about the corruption of the working class
Little Janie wakes up on the floor and she says
We're gonna have a real cool time tonight
Janie says we're all such a crush of want halfmad with loss
We are violated in our sleep and we weep and we toss and we turn and we burn
We are hypnotised we are crosseyed we are pimped we are bitched
We are told such monstrous lies
Janie wakes up and she says
We're gonna have a real cool time tonight
Mr Sandman, he has a certain appetite for Janie in repose
He digs her pretty knees and that she is completely naked underneath all her clothes
He likes to congregate around the intersection of Janie's jeans, yeah
Mr Sandman the inseminator he opens her up like a love letter and enters her dreams
Little Janie wakes up and she says
We're gonna have a real good time tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
We're gonna have a real good time
Come on, come on, come on
We're gonna have a real good time
I know you've heard it all before
But I'm sorry for this three year war
For the setting up of camps
and wire and trenches
I'm sorry for the other night
I know sorry it don't make it right
I'm sorry for things I can't even mention
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog
You keep nailing me back into my box
I'm sorry I keep popping back up
With my crazy mouth
and jangling jester's cap
I'm sorry I ever wrote that book
I'm sorry for the way I look
But there ain't a lot that
I can do about that
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry about the hospital
Some things are unforgivable
That things simply cannot be forgiven
I was not equipped to know how to care
Amnd on the occassions I came up for air
I saw my life and wondered
what the hell I had been living
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very very sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry about all your friends
I hope they'll speak to me again
I said before I'd pay for all the damages
I'm sorry it's just rotten luck
I'm sorry I've forgotten how to fuck
It's just that I think my heart
and soul are kind of famished
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog
Forgive me, baby but don't worry
Love is always having to
say you're sorry
And I am, from my head
down to my shoes
I'm sorry that I'm always pissed
I'm sorry that I exist
And when I look into your eyes
I can see you're sorry too
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm sitting feeling sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very thirsty in the Sorry Dog
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm feeling very sorry in the Thirsty Dog
The wintergreen, the juniper
The cornflower and the chicory
All the words you said to me
Still vibrating in the air
The elm, the ash and the linden tree
The dark and deep, enchanted sea
The trembling moon and the stars unfurled
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again
John Willmot penned his poetry
riddled with the pox
Nabakov wrote on index cards,
at a lectem, in his socks
St. John of the Cross did his best stuff
imprisoned in a box
And JohnnyThunders was half alive
when he wrote Chinese Rocks
Well, me, I'm lying here, with nothing in my ears
Me, I'm lying here, with nothing in my ears
Me, I'm lying here, for what seems years
I'm just lying on my bed with nothing in my head
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again
Karl Marx squeezed his carbuncles
while writing Das Kapital
And Gaugin, he buggered off, man,
and went all tropical
While Philip Larkin stuck it out
in a library in Hull
And Dylan Thomas died drunk in
St. Vincent's hospital
I will kneel at your feet
I will lie at your door
I will rock you to sleep
I will roll on the floor
And I'll ask for nothing
Nothing in this life
I'll ask for nothing
Give me everlasting life
I just want to move the world
I just want to move the world
I just want to move the world
I just want to move
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again
So if you got a trumpet, get on your feet,
brother, and blow it
If you've got a field, that don't yield,
well get up and hoe it
I look at you and you look at me and
deep in our hearts know it
That you weren't much of a muse,
but then I weren't much of a poet
I will be your slave
I will peel you grapes
Up on your pedestal
With your ivory and apes
With your book of ideas
With your alchemy
O Come on
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send that stuff on down to me
Send it all around the world
Cause here she comes, my beautiful girl
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes, my beautiful world
There she goes again
There is a town
Where I was born
Far far away
Across the sea
And in that town
Where I was born
I would dream
That one day
I would leave
And cross the sea
And so it goes
And so it seems
That God lives only in our dreams
In our dreams
And now I live
In this town
I walk these dark streets
Up and down, up and down
Under a dark sky
And I dream
That one day
I'll go back home
And so it goes
And so it seems
That God lives only in our dreams
In our dreams
Just like a bird that sings up the sun
In a dawn so very dark
Such is my faith for you
Such is my faith
And all the world's darkness can't swallow up
A single spark
Such is my love for you
Such is my love
There is a kingdom
There is a king
And he lives without
And he lives within
The starry heavens above me
The moral law within
So the world appears
So the world appears
This day so sweet
It will never come again
So the world appears
Through this mist of tears
There is a kingdom
There is a king
And he lives without
And he lives within
I took a walk down to the port
Where strangers meet and do consort
All blinkered with desire
And a winter fog moved thickly on
A winter fog moved thickly on
A winter fog moved thickly on
Now, who will be the witness
When the fog's too thick to see
And I saw a friend beside a wall
Her hands were raised in supplication
And her face I could not see at all
And I raised my hands in rage
And brought them down again
And we entered through the eastern door
And I entered through the eastern door
And she entered through the eastern door
Now, who will be the witness
When you're all to blind to see
O yes, yes, yes
And time gets somewhat muddled here
But no matter, no matter
Here come the events all tumbling down
Now, beyond the wall was a great garden
Into which we passed
Me and my friend
And the place was all overgrown with weeds
And behold from its centre there rose a great fountain
The fountain with the healing waters
And we knelt down by the rim
And I dipped my hand in
And she dipped her hand in too
And I said "Are you healed?"
And she said "Well are you healed?"
And I said "Yes, I'm healed"
And she said "Well, yes I'm healed then too"
And I said "Babe, you are a liar"
"Babe, you are a liar"
"Babe, you are a liar, too"
Now, who will be the witness
When you're all to healed to see
And I kissed her once, I kissed her twice
And made my way to leave her
And she raised her hand up to her face
And brought it down again
I said "That gesture, it will haunt me"
"That gesture it will haunt me"
And I left there by the eastern door
She left there by the western door
Now, who will be the witness there
When you're blind and you can't see
Who will be the witness there
When you're all so clean and you cannot see
Who will be the witness there
When your friends are everywhere
Who will be the witness there
And your enemies have ceased to care
Down in the willow garden, me and my love did meet
And as we sat acourting, my love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of burgundy wine my love, she did not know
And so I poisoned that dear little girl along the banks below
Along the banks below
I drew my saber through her it was a bloody night
I threw her in the river, which was a dreadful sight
My father often told me that money would set me free
And so I murdered that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly
Whose name was Rose Connelly
My father sits at his cabin door wiping his teardimmed eyes
His only son soon should walk to yonder scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun the scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly
Whose name was Rose Connelly
Whose name was Rose Connelly
Go son, go down to the water
And see the women weeping there
Then go up into the mountains
The men, they are weeping too
Father, why are all the women weeping?
They are weeping for their men
Then why are all the men there weeping?
They are weeping back at them
This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and women sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
Father, why are all the children weeping?
They are merely crying son
O, are they merely crying, father?
Yes, true weeping is yet to come
This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and women sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
O father tell me, are you weeping?
Your face seems wet to touch
O then I'm so sorry, father
I never thought I hurt you so much
This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While we rock ourselves to sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
But I won't be weeping long
But I won't be weeping long
But I won't be weeping long
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
And was she there? And was she there?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
Tell me how many coaches long?
Tell me how many coaches long?
What did she wear? And what did she wear?
Tell me how many coaches long?
Tell me when did the whistle blow?
Tell me when did the whistle blow?
And did she tie her hair?
And did she tie her hair?
Tell me when did the whistle blow?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
And was she there? And was she there?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
I married my wife on the day of the eclipse
Our friends awarded her courage with gifts
Now as the nights grow longer and the season shifts
I look to my sorrowful wife
Who is quietly tending her flowers
Who is quietly tending her .....
The water is high on the beckoning river
I made her a promise I could not deliver
And the cry of the birds sends a terrible shiver
Through me and my sorrowful wife
Who is shifting the furniture around
Who is shifting the furniture around
Now we sit beneath the knotted Yew
And the bluebells bob around our shoes
The task of remembering the telltale clues
Goes to my lovely, my sorrowful wife
Who is counting the days on her fingers
Who is counting the days on her .....
Come on and help me babe
Come on now
Help me babe
I was blind
The grass here grows long and high
Twists right up to the sky
White clouds roll on by
Come on now and help me babe
I was blind
I was a fool babe
I was blind
Come on now
A loose wind last night blew down
Black trees bent to the ground
Their blossoms made such a sound
That I could not hear myself think babe
Come on now
And help me babe
Help me now
I was blind
I was a fool
Guitar thug blew into town.
His eyes like wheels spinnin' round.
Jerkinoff at every sound.
Layin' all his crosses down.
He got Six Strings.
The Six Strings that drew blood.
The bar is full of HolyJoes.
Around the neck of our consumptive rose
is the root of all his sorrows.
He got Six Strings.
Six Strings that drew blood.
Six Strings that drew blood.
In the bathroom under cover.
He turns on one tap to discover.
He's smashed his teeth out on the other.
Well he look in the mirror and say
don't fuck me brother.
Cause I got Six Strings.
Six Strings that drew blood.
Numbin' the runt of reputation they call rat fame.
TopE as a tourniquet.
A low tune whistles across his grave.
Forever the master and the slave of his Six Strings.
Six Strings that drew blood.
As I walk these narrow streets
Where a million passin feet have trod before me
With my guitar in my hand
Suddenly I realize nobody knows me
Where yesterday the multitude
Screamed and cried my name out for a song
Today the streets are empty
And the crowds have all gone home
I pass a million houses
But there is no place that I belong
All I knew to give you
Was song after song after song
All the truths I tried to tell you
Were as distant to you as the moon
Born 200 years too late
And 200 years too soon
I'm a child of this age
Locked into the pages of your book
And when I am but dust and clay
And all the children stop to take a look
Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform
And the heights I did aspire
Or will they tear out the pages of the book
To light a fire
With the rain on my face
There is no place that I belong
Did you forget this fucking singer so soon?
And did you forget my song?
Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history, baby
Every time you come around
Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you come around
We talk about it all night long
We define our moral ground
But when I crawl into your arms
Everything comes tumbling down
Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history, baby
Every time you come around
Your face has fallen sad now
For you know the time is nigh
When I must remove your wings
And you, you must try to fly
Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history, baby
Every time you come around
Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you come around
The moon is in the gutter
And the stars wash down the sink
I am the king of the blues
I scape the clay off my shoes
And wade down the gutter and the moon
The moon blinds my eye with opal cataracts
As I cut through the sawmills and the stacks,
Leaping over the gully where I would one day take Lucy
Then wash up my hands in the gutter and the moon.
Such a long way from home, just me and
The moon is in the gutter
All my plans are flushed down the drain
I wander lonely as a cloud
Over memories at her mound
Then lie down in the bitter gutter moon
It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row,
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.
And I'll say it again
I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner meals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth.
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.
Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.
The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath at my hind
They are sick breath gathering at my hind
I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
Like my good hand I
tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.
My killhand is called E.V.I.L.
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.
Tis a longsuffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood.
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this looks of disbelief.
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
Nor a motive why.
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way I'm helping
To be done with all this twisted of the truth.
A lie for a lie
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is melting
And I think my blood is boiling
And in a way I'm spoiling
All the fun with all this truth and consequence.
An eye for an eye
And a truth for a truth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof.
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And anyway there was no proof
But I'm not afraid to tell a lie.
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of truth.
An eye for an eye
And a truth for a truth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie.
Orpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed
Wondering what to do
With a lump of wood, a piece of wire
And a little pot of glue
O Mamma O Mamma
He sawed at the wood with half a heart
And glued it top to bottom
He strung a wire in between
He was feeling something rotten
O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus looked at his instrument
And he gave the wire a pluck
He heard a sound so beautiful
He gasped and said O my God
O Mamma O Mamma
He rushed inside to tell his wife
He went racing down the halls
Eurydice was still asleep in bed
Like a sack of cannonballs
O Mamma O Mamma
Look what I've made, cried Orpheus
And he plucked a gentle note
Eurydice's eyes popped from their sockets
And her tongue burst through her throat
O Mamma O Mamma
O God, what have I done, he said
As her blood pooled in the sheets
But in his heart he felt a bliss
With which nothing could compete
O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus went leaping through the fields
Strumming as hard as he did please
Birdies detonated in the sky
Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees
O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled
He hit a G minor 7
He woke up God from a deep, deep sleep
God was a major player in heaven
O Mamma O Mamma
God picked up a giant hammer
And He threw it with an thunderous yell
It smashed down hard on Orpheus' head
And knocked him down a well
O Mamma O Mamma
The well went down very deep
Very deep went down the well
The well went down so very deep
Well, the well went down to hell
O Mamma O Mamma
Poor Orpheus woke up with a start
All amongst the rotting dead
His lyre tacked safe under his arm
His brains all down his head
O Mamma O Mamma
Eurydice appeared brindled in blood
And she said to Orpheus
If you play that fucking thing down here
I'll stick it up your orifice!
O Mamma O Mamma
This lyre lark is for the birds, said Orpheus
It's enough to send you bats
Let's stay down here, Eurydice, dear
And we'll have a bunch of screaming brats
O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time
He was on a real low down bummer
And stared deep into the abyss and said
This one is for Mamma
O Mamma O Mamma
O Mamma O Mamma
It was the dirty end of winter
Along the loom of the land
When I walked with sweet Sally
Hand upon hand
And the wind it bit bitter
For a boy of no means
With no shoes on his feet
And a knife in his jeans
Along the loom of the land
The mission bells peeled
From the tower at Saint Mary's
Down to Reprobate Fields
And I saw that the world
Was all blessed and bright
And Sally breathed softly
In the majestic night
O baby please don't cry
And try to keep
Your little hand upon my shoulder
Now go to sleep
The elms and the poplars
Were turning their backs
Past the rumbling station
We followed the tracks
We found an untrodden path
And followed it down
The moon in the sky
Like a dislodged crown
My hands they burned
In the folds of her coat
Breathing milky white air
From deep in her throat
O baby please don't cry
And try to keep
Your little head upon my shoulder
Now go to sleep
I told Sally in whispers
I'll never bring you harm
Her breast it was small
And warm in my palm
I told her the moon
Was a magical thing
That it shone gold in winter
And silver in spring
And we walked and walked
Across the endless sands
Just me and my Sally
Along the loom of the land
O baby please don't cry
And try to keep
Your little head upon my shoulder
Now go to sleep
They found Mary Bellows cuffed to the bed
With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
O poor Mary Bellows
She'd grown up hungry, she'd grown up poor
She left her home in Arkansas
O poor Mary Bellows
She wanted to see the deep blue sea
She travelled across Tennessee
O poor Mary Bellows
She met a man along the way
He introduced himself as Richard Slade
O poor Mary Bellows
Poor Mary thought that she might die
When she saw the ocean for the first time
O poor Mary Bellows
She checked into a cheap little place
Richard Slade carried in her old suitcase
O poor Mary Bellows
"I'm a good girl, sir", she said to him
I couldn't possibly permit you in
O poor Mary Bellows
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye
And turned away without goodbye
O poor Mary Bellows
She sat on her bed and thought of home
With the sea breeze whistling all alone
O poor Mary Bellows
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor
And undid the latch on the front door
O poor Mary Bellows
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
O poor Mary Bellows
So mothers keep your girls at home
Don't let them journey all alone
Tell them this world is full of danger
And to shun the company of strangers
O poor Mary Bellows
O poor Mary Bellows
Oh please don't send me out
Said the man with the hammer, hammering the anvil
I been walking on a road of rocks
And I keep on hammering, keep on hammering, keep on hammering,
Hammering the anvil
Don't let the sun go down
Said the man with the fire, firing the furnace
I been buried in the snow
And I keep on firing, keep on firing, keep on firing,
Firing the furnace
Oh don't talk to me
Said the man with the chisel, chiseling the surface
I been sleeping far too long
And I keep on chiseling, keep on chiseling, keep on chiseling,
Chiseling the surface
I don't know what you mean
Said the man with the shovel, shoveling the ashes
I been digging in the frozen ground
And I keep on shoveling, keep on shoveling, keep on shoveling,
Shoveling the ashes
Shoveling the ashes
Chiseling the surface
Firing the furnace
Hammering the anvil
One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man is gone
The good son walks into the field
He is a tiller, he has a tiller's hands
But down in his heart now
He lays down his queer plans
Against his brother and against his family
Yet he worships his brother
And he worships his mother
But it's his father, he says, is an unfair man
The good son
The good son
The good son
The good son has sat and often wept
Beneath a malign star by which he's kept
And the nighttime in which he's wrapped
Speaks of good and speaks of evil
And he calls to his mother
And he calls to his father
But they are deaf in the shadows
Of his brother's truancy
The good son
The good son
The good son
The good son
And he curses his mother
And he curses his father
And he curses his virtue like an unclean thing
The good son
The good son
The good son
One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man
One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man
One more man gone
One more man gone
One more man
I live in a town called Millhaven
And it's small and it's mean and it's cold
But if you come around just as the sun goes down
You can watch the whole town turn to gold
It's around about then that I used to go aroaming
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die
My name is Loretta but I prefer Lottie
I'm closing in on my fifteenth year
And if you think you have seen a pair of eyes more green
Then you sure didn't see them around here
My hair is yellow and I'm always acombing
La la la la La la la lie
Mama often told me we all got to die
You must have heard about The Curse Of Millhaven
How last Christmas Bill Blake's little boy didn't come home
They found him next week in One Mile Creek
His head bashed in and his pockets full of stones
Well, just imagine all the wailing and moaning
La la la la La la la lie
Even little Billy Blake's boy, he had to die
Then Professor O'Rye from Millhaven High
Found nailed to his door his prizewinning terrier
Then next day the old fool brought little Biko to school
And we all had to watch as he buried her
His eulogy to Biko had all the tears aflowing
La la la la La la la lie
Even God's little creatures, they have to die
Our little town fell into a state of shock
A lot of people were saying things that made little sense
Then the next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe
Was found in the fountain of the Mayor's residence
Foul play can really get a small town going
La la la la La la la lie
Even God's children all have to die
Then, in a cruel twist of fate, old Mrs Colgate
Was stabbed but the job was not complete
The last thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead
Was, "My killer is Loretta and she lives across the street!"
Twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning
La la la la La la la lie
The young ones, the old ones, they all gotta die
Yes, it is I, Lottie. The Curse Of Millhaven
I've struck horror in the heart of this town
Like my eyes ain't green and my hair ain't yellow
It's more like the other way around
I gotta pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming
La la la la La la la lie
Sooner or later we all gotta die
Since I was no bigger than a weavil they've been saying I was evil
That if "bad" was a boot that I'd fit it
That I'm a wicked young lady, but I've been trying hard lately
O fuck it! I'm a monster! I admit it!
It makes me so mad my blood really starts agoing
La la la la La la la lie
Mama always told me that we all gotta die
Yeah, I drowned the Blakey kid, stabbed Mrs. Colgate, I admit
Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed
But I never crucified little Biko, that was two junior high school psychos
Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkinsized head
I'll sing to the lot, now you got me going
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children have all gotta die
There were all the others, all our sisters and brothers
You assumed were accidents, best forgotten
Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo?
Everyone assumed the "Warning" signs had followed them to the bottom
Well, they're underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing
La la la la La la la lie
Even twenty little children, they had to die
And the fire of '91 that razed the Bella Vista slum
There was the biggest shitfight this country's ever seen
Insurance companies ruined, land lords getting sued
All cause of wee girl with a can of gasoline
Those flames really roared when the wind started blowing
La la la la La la la lie
Rich man, poor man, all got to die
Well I confessed to all these crimes and they put me on trial
I was laughing when they took me away
Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah
It ain't home, but you know, it's fucking better than jail
It ain't such bad old place to have a home in
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die
Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests
I keep telling them they're out to get me
They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, "Why of course!
There is so much more I could have done if they'd let me!"
So it's Rorschach and Prozac and everything is groovy
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all have to die
La la la la La la la lie
I'm happy as a lark and everything is fine
Singing La la la la La la la lie
Yeah, everything is groovy and everything is fine
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they gotta die
And noone saw the carny go
And the weeks flew by
Until they moved on the show
Leaving his caravan behind
It was parked out on the south east ridge
And as the company crossed the bridge
With the first rain filling the bonedry river bed
It shone, just so, upon the edge
Dogboy, atlas, halfman, the geeks, the hired hands
There was not one among them that did not cas an eye behind
In the hope that the carny would return to his own kind
And the carny had a horse, all skin and bone
A bowbacked nag, that he named "Sorrow"
How it is buried in a shallow grave
In the then parched meadow
And the dwarves were given the task of digging the ditch
And laying the nag's carcass in the ground
And boss Bellini, waving his smoking pistol around
saying "The nag is dead meat"
"We caint afford to carry dead weight"
The whole company standing about
Not making a sound
And turning to dwarves perched on the enclosure gate
The boss says "Bury this lump of crow bait"
And thean the rain came
Everybody running for their wagons
Tying all the canvas flaps down
The mangy cats crowling in ther cages
The birdgirl flapping and squawking around
The whole valley reeking of wet beast
Wet beast and rotten hay
Freak and brute creation
Packed up and on their way
The three dwarves peering from their wagon's hind
Moses says to Noah "We shoulda dugga deepa one"
Their grizzled faces like dying moons
Still dirty from the digging done
And as the company passed from the valley
Into a higher ground
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow
And on the mound
Until nothing was left, nothing at all
Except the body of Sorrow
That rose in time
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil
And a murder of crows did circle round
First one, then the others flapping blackly down
And the carny's van still sat upon the edge
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge
And the rain it hammered down
And noone saw the carny go
I say it's funny how things go
Say goodbye, my one true lover
And we'll steal a lover's song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival has gone
Oh my love, the dawn is breaking
And my tears are falling rain
For the carnival is over
We may never meet again
Like a drum my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine
Now the cloak of night is falling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die
There was a thick set man with frog eyes
who was standing by the door
and a little bald man with wingnut ears
was waiting in the car
Well Robert Moore passed the frogeyed man
as he walked into the bar,
and Betty Coltrane she jumped under her table.
"What's your pleasure?" asked the barman
he had a face like boiled meat
"There's a girl called Betty Coltrane
that I have come to see"
"But I ain't seen that girl 'round here
for more than a week"
and Betty Coltrane she hid beneath the table.
Well, then in came a sailior with
mermaids tattooed on his arms,
Followed by the man with the wingnut ears
who was waitin' in the car
Well, Robert Moore sensed trouble,
he'd seen it comin' from afar
and Betty Coltrain she gasped beneath the table.
Well, the sailor said "I'm looking for my wife,
they call her Betty Coltrain!"
The frogeyed man said "That can't be
that's my wife's maiden name."
And the man with the wingnut ears said,
"Hey, I married her back in Spain!"
and Betty Coltrain crossed herself beneath the table.
Well, Robert Moore stepped up and said
"That woman is my wife."
and he drew a silver pistol
and a wicked bowie knife
And he shot the man with the wingnut ears
straight between the eyes
and Betty Coltrain, she moaned under the table.
The frogeyed man jumped at Robert Moore,
who stabbed him in the chest
and as Mister Frogeyes died he said
"Betty, your the girl that I loved best!"
The sailor pulled a razor,
Robert blasted it to bits
"And Betty, I know you're under the table."
"Well have no fear," said Robert Moore,
"I do not want to hurt you!"
"Never a woman did'na love me
half as much as you.
You are the blessed' sun, girl
and you are the sacred moon."
and Betty shot his legs out from under the table!
Well, Robert Moore went down heavy
with a crash upon the floor
and over to his trashin' body
Betty Coltrain she did crawl.
She put the gun to the back of head
and pulled the trigger once more
and blew his brains out all over the table!
Well Betty stood up and shook her head
and waved the smoke away.
Said, "I'm sorry Mr Barman
to leave your place this way."
As she emptied out their wallets she said,
"I'll collect my severence pay."
and then she winked and threw a dollar on the table.
How is little Thomas Magee?
Thomas Magee, he swallowed a key
Jedediah, little Thomas Magee
Holly holly, just let him be...
His wife now, little Thomas Magee
called his kettle ? on the telephone
heart was beating in my chest
I needed something I could not have guessed
the phone kept ringing there's no one home
ran to his house, rapped on my window
blood was pumping much too fast
I stuck my finger through the glass
strange music playing on the radio
way down low
and carry me home
Pray like Peter, preach like Paul
Jesus died to save us all
I climbed through the window
and crawled on the floor
I wrecked all of the furniture
but I still couldn't find what I was looking for
problems still reclaimed as a whole
cannot be solved and must be outgrown
the bottomless night still could not be known
the empty ring on the telephone
and the strange music playing on the radio
yeah way down low
and carry me home
Where you go?
Where do u go?
swing low, baby,
save my soul
Where do u go?
Where do u go?
yeah swing low baby save my soul
Come over here, babe
It ain't that bad
I don't claim to understand
The troubles that you've had
But the dogs you say they fed you to
Lay their muzzles in your lap
And the lions that they led you to
Lie down and take a nap
The ones you fear are wind and air
And I love you without measure
It seems we can be happy now
Be it better late than never
Sweetheart, come to me
The burdens that you carry now
Are not of your creation
So let's not weep for their evil deeds
But for their lack of imagination
Today's the time for courage, babe
Tomorrow can be for forgiving
And if he touches you again with his stupid hands
His life won't be worth living
Sweetheart, come to me
Walk with me now under the stars
For it's a clear and easy pleasure
And be happy in my company
For I love you without measure
Walk with me now under the stars
It's a safe and easy pleasure
It seems we can be happy now
It's late but it ain't never
It's late but it ain't never
It's late but it ain't never
Through the windswept coastal trees
Where the dead come rising from the sea
With a teddybear clamped between her knees
She says, where can my loverman be?
Well, I'm down here, babe, with the Eskimos With the polar bears and the Arctic snow
With a party of penguins who do not know flow
How I can get back to thee
Well I'm gonna ask you, babe
Oh baby don't you go
Oh no no no
Oh baby, don't you go
All supernatural on me
Once I was your hearts desire
Now I am the ape hunkered by the fire
With my knuckles dragging through the mire
You float by so majestically
You're my north, my south, my east, my west
You are the girl that I love best
With an army of tanks bursting from your chest
I wave my little white flag at thee
Can you see it, babe?
Oh baby don't you go
Oh no no no
Oh baby, don't you go
All supernatural on me
Now I've turned the mirrors to wall
I've emptied out the peopled halls
I've nailed shut the windows and locked the doors
There is no escape, you see
I chase you up and down the stairs
Under tables and over chairs
I reach out and I touch your hair
And it cuts me like a knife
For there is always something
other little thing you gotta do
Oh baby don't you go
Oh baby, no no no
Oh don't you go
All supernatural on me
Sunday's got a slave
Monday's got one too
Sunday's got a slave
Monday's got one too
Our sufferings are countless
Our pleasures are motley few
Spend all day digging my grave
Now go get Sunday's slave
Tuesday sleeps in a stable
Wednesday's in a chains
Tuesday gathers up the crumbs under the table
Wednesday dare not complain
My heart has collapsed on the tracks of a runaway train
Just whisper his name
And here comes Sunday's slave
The hands in the stable are willing and able to pay
If you feel at a loss, man, just who is the bossman
Ask the blood of one of its bad days
For his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery
He insists that he piss in your fist
But he still takes the money anyway
The master's a bastard
But don't tell Sunday's slave
Thursday's angered the master
O.K. so Friday's gonna pay
Thursday's angered the master
Yeah, so Friday's gonna pay
One night on the rack and he's back saddling up Saturday
You can only whisper his name
But not on Sundays
Never on Sundays
O Not on Sunday's slave
Sugar Sugar Sugar
That man is bad
The road he drives you down
O sugar its a drag
That road it twists
That road is crossed
Its down that road
A lot of little girls go lost
Sugar Sugar Sugar
Keep on driving on
Until the City of right
Becomes the City of wrong
That stretch is long
You'll sleep and slide
That stretch will find you
Gagged and tied
The hunter lies
In a lowly ditch
His eyes they sting
And his fingers twitch
You'll be his queen for the night
But the morning you'll wake
With the Lords and high ladies
Of the bottom of the lake
Sugar sugar sugar
That man is wild
And sugar, you know
That you're merely a child
He will laugh
And hang your sheets to see
The tokens of your virginity
Sugar sugar sugar
Honey you're so sweet
And beside you baby
Nothing can complete
Sugar sugar sugar
Honey your so sweet
But beside you baby
A bad man sleeps
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray
You better pray, baby
Pray, baby, pray baby
You better pray baby
Sugar sugar sugar
That man is bad
And that's the bottom baby
Coming right up ahead
You can smell his fear
You can smell his love
As he wipes his mouth
On your altar cloth
Sugar sugar sugar
Try to understand
I'm an angel of God
I'm your guardian
He smells you innocence
And like a dog he comes
And like all the dogs he is
I shut him down
Sugar sugar sugar
I can't explain
Must I kill that cocksucker
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby
You better pray your daddy he ain't far away
You better pray baby pray baby pray baby
You better pray your daddy's come to take you away
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby
You better pray o tender prey baby tender prey
You better pray tender pray baby tender prey
Stranger than kindness
Bottled light from hotels
Wet hand from the volcano
Sobers your skin
Stranger than Kindness
You caress yourself
And grind my soft cold bones below
Your map of desire
Burned in your flesh
Even a fool can come
A strange lit stair
And find a rope hanging there
Stranger than kindness
Keys rain like heaven's hair
There is no home there is no bread
We sit at the gate and scratch
The gaunt fruit of passion
Dies in the light
Stranger than kindness
Your sleeping hands journey
Stranger than kindness
You hold me so carelessy close
Tell me I'm dirty
Stranger than kindness
All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
The light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow, it comes astealing
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come arunning
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
Gone are the days of rainbows
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunderbolts and sparks
Straight at you
But I'll come arunning
Straight to you
But I'll come arunning
One more time
Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk howling at the moon
The chariots of angels are colliding
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
The cops are hanging around the house
The cars outside look like they've got the blues
The moon don't know if it's day or night
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes
You're making coffee for everyone concerned
Someone points to this and someone points to that
Everyone is saying that you should lie down
But you ain't having none of that
And I say to the sleepy summer rain
With a complete absence of pain
You might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you
Hide your eyes, hide your tears,
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you
Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all
Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you
It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards
He wore ratdrawn shoes and an old stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, "Never ever come back no more"
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
He said "Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am"
The barkeeper said, "No, and I don't give a good goddamn"
To Stagger Lee
He said, "Well bartender, it's plain to see
I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee"
Mr. Stagger Lee
Barkeep said, "Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day"
Mr Stagger Lee
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said
'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head
Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt
With Stagger Lee
She saw the barkeep, said, "O God, he can't be dead!"
Stag said, "Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head"
She said, "You ain't look like you scored in quite a time.
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime"
Mr. Stagger Lee
"But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,
Mr. Stagger Lee"
"I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass"
Said Stagger Lee
"I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole"
Said Stagger Lee
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, "You must be
That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee"
"Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead"
Said Stagger Lee
Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
And Stag filled him full of lead
It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards

Said Stagger Lee
Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
And Stag filled him full of lead
Through the woods, and frosted moors
Past the snowcaked hedgerows I
Bed down upon the drifting snow
Sleep beneath the melting sky
I whisper all your names
I know not where you are
But somewhere, somewhere, somewhere here
Upon this wild abandoned star
And I'm full of love
And I'm full of wonder
And I'm full of love
And I'm falling under
I have no abiding memory
No awakening, no flaming dart
No word of consolation
No arrow through my heart
Only a feeble notion
A glimmer from afar
That I cling to with my fingers
As we go spinning wildly through the stars
And I'm full of love
And I'm full of wonder
And I'm full of love
And I'm falling under
The wind lifts me to my senses
I rise up with the dew
The snow turns to streams of light
The purple heather grows anew
I call you by your name
I know not where you are
But somehow, somewhere, sometime soon
Upon this wild abandoned star
And I'm full of love
And I'm full of wonder
And I'm full of love
And I'm falling under
Sorrow's child sits by the river
Sorrow's child hears not the water
Sorrow's child sits by the river
Sorrow's child hears not the water
And just when it seems as though
You've got strength enough to stand
Sorrow's child all weak and strange
Stands waiting at your hand
Sorrow's child steps in the water
Sorrow's child you follow after
Sorrow's child wades in deeper
Sorrow's child invites you under
And just when you thought as though
All your tears were wept and done
Sorrow's child grieves not what has passed
But all the past still yet to come
Sorrow's child sits by the water
Sorrow's child your arms enfold her
Sorrow's child you're loathe to befriend her
Sorrow's child but in sorrow surrender
And just when is seems as though
All your tears were at an end
Sorrow's child lifts up her hand
And she brings it down again
Have mercy on me, sir
Allow me to impose on you
I have no place to stay
And my bones are cold right through
I will tell you a story
Of a man and his family
And I swear that it is true
Ten years ago I met a girl named Joy
She was a sweet and happy thing
Her eyes were bright blue jewels
And we were married in the spring
I had no idea what happiness and little love could bring
Or what life had in store
But all things move toward their end
All things move toward their their end
On that you can be sure
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Then one morning I awoke to find her weeping
And for many days to follow
She grew so sad and lonely
Became Joy in name only
Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow
And a dark and grim force set sail
Farewell happy fields
Where joy forever dwells
 Hail horrors hail 
Was it an act of contrition or some awful premonition
As if she saw into the heart of her final bloodsoaked night
Those lunatic eyes, that hungry kitchen knife
Ah, I see sir, that I have your attention!
Well, could it be?
How often I've asked that question
Well, then in quick succession
We had babies, one, two, three
We called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly
They were their mother's children
Their eyes were bright blue jewels
And they were quiet as a mouse
There was no laughter in the house
No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly
"No wonder", people said, "poor mother Joy's so melancholy"
Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home
I was visiting a sick friend
I was a doctor then
Joy and the girls were on their own
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Joy had been bound with electrical tape
In her mouth a gag
She'd been stabbed repeatedly
And stuffed into a sleeping bag
In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives
Method of murder much the same as my wife's
Method of murder much the same as my wife's
It was midnight when I arrived home
Said to the police on the telephone
Someone's taken four innocent lives
They never caught the man
He's still on the loose
It seems he has done many many more
Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim's blood
The police are investigating at tremendous cost
In my house he wrote "his red right hand"
That, I'm told is from Paradise Lost
The wind round here gets wicked cold
But my story is nearly told
I fear the morning will bring quite a frost
And so I've left my home
I drift from land to land
I am upon your step and you are a family man
Outside the vultures wheel
The wolves howl, the serpents hiss
And to extend this small favour, friend
Would be the sum of earthly bliss
Do you reckon me a friend?
The sun to me is dark
And silent as the moon
Do you, sir, have a room?
Are you beckoning me in?
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up and turning me down
Making me smile and making me frown
In a world that was small
I once lived in a time there was peace with no trouble at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling unknown shook my heart, made me want you to stay
All of my nights and all of my days
I gotta tell you now
Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Something has invaded my nights
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
Changing the grey and changing the blue
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you
I've got to know if this is the real thing
I've got to know what's making my heart sing
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime
Each minute spent with you is the right time
Every hour, every day
You touch me and my mind goes astray
Lover, lover, goodbye
So slowly goes the night
I trace the print of your body with my hand
Like the map of some forbidden land
I trace the ghosts of your bones
With my trembling hand
Dark is my night
But darker is my day yeah
I must've been blind
Out of my mind
Not to read the warning signs
How goes it?
It goes lonely
So slowly goes the night
Ten lonely days, ten lonely nights
I watch the moon get flayed anew
Until the moom becomes the skinning tool
I send the skins of my sins out to cover and comfort you
I know of a Heaven
And honey I know of a Hell yeah
I hang my head
In my bed
And remember what you said
"One evening, I'm leaving"
And I laughed and checked her breathing
And said darling
Go slowly through the knight
O baby, I feel the heal of time
I wake to find you sitting here
Cutting tangels out of your hair
Singing a song that's all wrong
Hey, but that's alright, I don't care
O darling forgive me
For all the misery yeah
I embrace an empty space
And your laughing song it fades
Where goes it?
It goes some place
Where it's lonely
And black as the night
Come back, darling and put things right
I hang my head and cry cry cry
Darling, all night I try
To cease on a reason for this mad mad season
The nights, they are so long now
I can't remember it being light
Call it sleep, call it death, call it what you like
But only sleep, dear
Only sleep brings you back to life yeah
I hang my head
I toss and I sweat
I never never can forget
How goes it?
I'm going, but slowly slowly going
And we both know that it's gonna be alright
But it ain't you who has to cry cry cry
Ten lonely days, ten lonely nights
Since you left my side side side
Yesterday the sun was shining but you're finding the sun it
Don't shine all the time
A winter day suddenly came your way
And you ran into your mind
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah
Do you think you're ready for me?
Oh and yesterday is gone forever and ever, never
To be again
You looked for the sunshine, that brought warmth to your mind
But find only rain
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah
No, you're not ready for me
But when yesterday becomes a memory, a memory
That we uncovered in time
If you still remember that cold September
I reigned in your mind
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah
Then you'd be ready for me
An old sentimental night
you roll me at your sides
you shot me down
Though I had no enemy here
you get me very near and shoot me down
shoot me down
your hands they flutter up
and shoot me down... in flames
Stand back baby, stand back and let me breathe
I think I must be filin' outta here
I can hear the grass grow
I can hear the melting snow
I can feel your breath against my ear
I might just disappear
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
Well, wouldn't that be nice?
I look into your eyes
it comes as no great surprise
you're gonna shoot me down
shoot me down
I know that when you smile
it'll only be a short little while
Shoot me down... in flames
Shoot me down
Shoot me down
you're gonna shoot me down
oh, in flames
shoot me down, shoot me down
shoot me down in flames
shoot me down in flames
shoot me down in flames
She passed by my window
Her eyes were all aglow
And bent to pick her glove she'd dropped
From the bright and brittle snow
Nature had spoken it in the Spring
With apple, plum and brand new pear
Have you time for my company?
No, I said, I have none to spare
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
I ain't no loverboy
For apple, plum and brand new pear
Soon wither on the ground
She slapped the snow from off her glove
And moved on without a sound
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
I ain't no loverboy
Once she lay open like a road
Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from
But she fell away
She fell away
Shed me like a skin
She fell away
Left me holding everything
Once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me th the brink
The fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all
She fell away
She fell away
She fell away
Well, I lived with one
Well, I lived with one, I lived with two,
I even lived with a third
I wanna tell you about number one
He was a miserable shitwringing turd
Like he reminded me of some evil gnome
Shakin hands was like shakin a hot, fat, oily bone
Holdin on for far too long
Yes he took me in, he took me in
He said that I looked pale and thin
I told him he looked fat
His lips were red and lickin wet
His house was roastin hot
In fact it was a fuckin slum
Well then he hooked up with some slut from the same game
Black snow! Black snow!
Cocksuckstress, and I should know
Mean and vicious, her microphone always smelled suspicious
His and herpes bath towel type
If you know what I mean
I could not look at him, worm
He'd be takin a shower and who should walk in
He was the epitome of their type
Her middle name was Welcome, his was Wipe
Well you're on the shit list
Thrust and twist, twist and screw
You gave me a bad review
And maybe you think that it's all just water under the bridge
Well my UNfriend, I'm the type that holds a grudge
I'm your creator
I think you fuckin traitor, chronic masturbator,
Shitlicker, user, selfabuser, jigger jigger!
What rock did you crawl from?
Which ..... did you come?
You Judas, Brutus, Vitus, Scum!
Hey foureyes, come
That's right, it's a gun
Face is bubble, blood, and ...... street
Snowman with six holes clean into his fat fuckin guts
Psychotic drama mounts
Guts well deep then a spring is fount ?
I unload into his eyes
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.
O you know that I must say goodbye
To the little girl tree.
This wall I built around you
Is made out of stonelies.
O little girl the truth would be
An axe in thee.
O father look to your daughter
Brick of grief and stricken morter.
With this ring
This silver hoop of wire
I bind your maiden mainstream
Just to keep you as a child.
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.
O you know that I must say goodbye
To my little girl tree.
How fast your candy bones
Reached out for me.
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones
Crying out for me.
O you know that I must say goodbye.
Even though you will betray me
The very minute that I leave.
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree.
I rise up her girlchild lumps and slipping knots
Into her laden boughs
And amongst her roping limbs
Like a swollen neck vein branching
Into smaller lesser veins
That must all just sing and say goodbye
And let her blossom veils fly.
Her velvet gown.
Down down down.
Down down down.
Down down down and goodbye.
For you know that I must say goodbye.
To a rhythm softly tortured
Of a motion back and forth.
Thats a rhythm sweetly tortured
O thats the rhythm of the orchard.
And you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree.
For you know that I must die.
Down down down.
Down down down.
Down down down and goodbye.
For you know that I must die.
Yes you know that I must die.
Oo you know that I must die.
Born of the river,
Born of its neverchanging, neverchanging murky water
Huck standing like a Saint, upon its deck
If ya wanna catch a Saint,
then bait ja hook, let's take a walk...
'O come to me!, O come to me!' is what the dirtirty
say to Huck... HUCK
woahwoah, woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!
Straight in the arms of the city goes Huck,
down the heckoning streets of oppotunity
whistling his favorite riversong...
And a badblinenigger at the piano
Buts a sinisterbloolilt to that singalong
Huck senses somthing's wrong!
Sirens wail in the city,
and lilUlysses turn to putty
Ol man River's got a bone to pick!
Our boys hardly got a bone to suck!
He go, woahwoah, woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!
The moooon, its huge cycloptic eye
watches the city streets contract
twist and cripple and crack.
Saint Huck goes on a dog'sleg now
Saint Huck goes on a dog'sleg now
Why, you know the story!
Ya wake up one morning and ya find your a thug
blowing smoke fings in some dive
Ya fingers hot and itchin, cracking ya knuckles
Ya bull neck briseting...
Still Huck he ventures on whistling,
and Death reckons Huckleberry's time is up,
O woah woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!
Yonder go Huck, minus pocketwatch an' wallet gone
Skin shrinks wraps his skeleton
No wonder he got thinner, not, with his cold'n'skinny dinners!
Saint HuckaSaint Elvis, Saint HuckaSaint Elvis
O you recall the song ya used to singalong
Shifting the rivertrade on that ol' steamer
Life is only a dream!
But ya trade in the Mighty ol' man River
for the Dirty ol' Man Latrine!
The brothel shift
The hustle'n'the bustle and the greenbacks rustle
And all the sexycash
And the randycars
And the two dollar fucks
O o o ya onto luck, onto luck
Saint Huck! Huck!
I climbed the hill, lay in the grass
A little darkeyes girl drifted past
She said, "All the best has come, it could not last
And the worst is has come true"
Her hands were small and fluttered up
A lamb amongst the buttercups
I pulled on my coat and buttoned it up
For the worst it had come true
Sail away, sail away
To a place where your troubles can't follow
Sail away, sail away
Save all your tears for tomorrow
The fins of the city moved toward us
And the swallows swooped and the starlings warned us
And the peril in everything is assured us
That the worst it had come true
And all my sorrows made their bed beside me
The shame, the disgrace and the brutality
And she whispered then, "Let laughter flee
For the worst it has come true"
Dry your tears, forget why we're here
Leave all your sorrows behind you
Never lose heart, all things must pass
To a place where your troubles can't find you
She came beside me, amongst my coat
Her breath was warm against my throat
We clung to each other so very close
For the worst it had come true
Sail away, sail away
To a place where your heart will not shame you
Take my hand, through this night without end
For the worst it has come to claim you
Sail away, sail away
To a place where no one can betray you
Take my hand, through this night without end
For the worst it has come to claim you
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
We go down to the river where the willows weep
Take a naked root for a lovers seat
That rose out of the bitten soil
But sound to the ground by creeping ivy coils
O Mary you have seduced my soul
And I don't know right from wrong
Forever a hostage of your child's world
And then I ran my tincup heart along
The prison of her ribs
And with a toss of her curls
That little girl goes wading in
Rollin her dress up past her knee
Turning these waters into wine
Then she platted all the willow vines
Mary in the shallows laughing
Over where the carp dart
Spooked by the new shadows that she cast
Across these sad waters and across my heart
Just running scared, each place we go
So afraid, that he might show
Yeah, running scared, what would I do
If he came back and wanted you?
Just running scared, feeling low
Running scared that you love him so
Just running scared, afraid to lose
If he came back, which one would you choose?
And then all at once, he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
While my heart was breaking, which one would it be?
Then you turned round and walked right out on me
Let me say this to you
I'll be steadfast and true
And my love will never falter
The sea would crash about us
The waves would lash about us
I'll be your Rock of Gibraltar
Sometimes it's hard
And we're both caught off guard
But there's nothing I would ever alter
The wind could howl round our ears
For the next thousand years
I'd still be your Rock of Gibraltar
The best thing I done
Was to make you the one
Who I'd walk with down to the altar
You'd stand by me
And together we'd be
That great, steady Rock of Gibraltar
Under the big yellow moon
On our honeymoon
I took you on a trip to Malta
And all through the night
You held me so tight
Your great, steady Rock of Gibraltar
Could the powers that be
That things could so utterly alter?
All the plans that we laid
Could soon be betrayed
Betrayed like the Rock of Gibraltar
Please forgive me
If I appear unkind
But any fool can tell you
It's all in your mind
Down in the meadow
The old lion stirs
Puts his hand 'cross his mouth
He has no use for words
Poor little girl
With your handful of snow
Poor little girl
Had no way to know
And you've got me eating
You've got me eating
You've got me eating
Right out of your hand
I mean you no harm
When I tell you you're blind
Give a sucker an even break
He'll lose it all, every time
The airborne starlings circle
Over the frozen fields
The hollyhocks hang harmlessly
And the old lion yields
And you've got me eating
You've got me eating
You've got me eating
Right out of your hand
When I get home, I'm gunna clean up my house
When I get home, I'm gunna kick out that mouse
When I get home, I'm gunna put things in order
but right now, right right now, right now I'm aroaming
When I get home, I'm gunna make that call
When I get home, I'm gunna talk it through
When I get home, I'm gunna straighten it out
but right now, right now, right now I'm aroaming
When I get home, I'm gunna give up the booze
When I get home, I'm gunna get me some food
When I get home, I'm gunna quit them drugs
but right now, right now, right now I'm aroaming
When I get home, I'm gunna call my mother
When I get home, I'm gunna cook her some dinner
When I get home, I'm gunna invite my brothers
but right now, right right now, right now I'm aroaming
When I get home, I'm gunna see my little boy
When I get home, I'm buy him a little toy
When I get home, he's gunna jump for joy
but right now, right right now, right now I'm aroaming
When I get home, I'm gunna unpack my bags
When I get home, I'm gunna waash these dirty rags
When I get home, I'm gunna pack 'em up again
but I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go right back roaming.
Take a litle walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
in the humming wires
Hey man, you know
you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
a red right hand
He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul
Hey buddy, you know you're
never ever coming back
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand
You ain't got no money?
He'll get you some
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one
You ain't got no selfrespect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand
You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand
People just ain't no good
I think that's welll understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good
We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made pour vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds
The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
And never read a single word
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
Seasons came, Seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all
To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let aal the pinkeyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good
To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'd stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit
People just ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all
I went out walking the other day
The wind hung wet around my neck
My head it rung with screams and groans
From the night I spent amongst her bones
I past beside the mission house
Where that mad old buzzard, the reverend,
Shrieked and flapped about life after your dead
Well, I thought about my friend, Michel
How they rolled him in linoleum
And shot him in the neck
A bloody halo, like a thinkbubble
Circling his head
And I bellowed at the firmament
Looks like the rains are hear to stay
And the rain pissed down upon me
And washed me all away
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Well, the road is long
And the road is hard
And many fall by the side
But Papa won't leave you, Henry
So there ain't no need to cry
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
Well, the moon it looked exhausted
Like something you should pity
Spent an agespotted
Above the sizzling wires of the city
Well, it reminded me of her face
Her bleached and hungry eyes
Her hair was like a curtain
Falling open with the laughter
And closing with the lies
But the ghost of her still lingers on
Though she's passed through me
And is gone
The slum dogs, they are barking
And the rain children on the streets
And the tears that we will weep today
Will all be washed away
By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
For the road is long
And the road is hard
And many fall by the side
But Papa won't leave you, Henry
So there ain't no need to cry
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I came upon a little house
A little house upon a hill
And I entered through, the curtain hissed
Into the house with its bloodred bowels
Where wetlipped women with greasy fists
Crawled the ceilings and the walls
They filled me full of drink
And led me round the rooms
Naked and cold and grinning
Until everything went black
And I came down spinning
I awoke so drunk and full of rage
That I could hardly speak
A fag in a whalebone corset
Draping his dick across my cheek
And its into the shame
And its into a guilt
And its into the fucking fray
And the walls ran red around me
A warm arterial spray
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Well, the night is dark
And the night is deep
And its jaws are open wide
But Papa won't leave you, Henry
So there ain't no need to cry
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
It's the rainy season where I'm living
Death comes leaping out of every doorway
Wasting you for money, for your clothes
And for your nothing
Entire towns being washed away
Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways
Lynchmobs, death squads, babies being born without brains
The mad heat and the relentless rains
And if you stick your arm into that hole
It comes out sheared off to the bone
And with her kisses bubbling on my lips
I swiped the rain and nearly missed
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Well, the road is long
And the road is hard
And many fall by the side
But Papa won't leave you, Henry
So there ain't no need to cry
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
Bent Beneath my heavy load
Under his heavy load
Yeah, I went on down the road
Yeah, he went on down the road
And I went on down that road
I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My children lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wideawake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord
They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion,
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see in the way they looked at me
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me
Oh Lord Oh my lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh lord
Oh My Lord
Now I'm at the hairdressers
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, "What are you looking for?"
I scream, "The plot, the plot!"
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, "Leave us alone!" I say, "Hey, it's only me"
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver I can't even believe what I can see
Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but pray with care
For the tears that you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life that we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord
I am tall and I am thin
Of an enviable hight
And I've been known to be quite handsome
In a certain angle and in certain light
Well I entered into O'Malley's
Said, "O'Malley I have a thirst"
O'Malley merely smiled at me
Said "You wouldn't be the first"
I knocked on the bar and pointed
To a bottle on the shelf
And as O'Malley poured me out a drink
I sniffed and crossed myself
My hand decided that the time was nigh
And for a moment it slipped from view
And when it returned, it fairly burned
With confidence anew
Well the thunder from my steely fist
Made all the glasses jangle
When I shot him, I was so handsome
It was the light, it was the angle
"Neighbours!" I cried, "Friends!" I screamed
I banged my fist upon the bar
"I bear no grudge against you!"
And my dick felt long and hard
"I am the man for which no God waits
But for which the whole world yearns
I'm marked by darkness and by blood
And one thousand powderburns"
Well, you know those fish with the swollen lips
That clean the ocean floor
When I looked at poor O'Malley's wife
That's exactly what I saw
I jammed the barrel under her chin
And her face looked raw and vicious
Her head it landed in the sink
With all the dirty dishes
Her little daughter Siobhan
Pulled beers from dusk till down
And amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke
But she pulled the best beer in town
I swooped magnificent upon her
As she sat shivering in her grief
Like the Madonna painted on the churchhouse wall
In whale's blood and banana leaf
Her throat it crumbled in my fist
And I spun heroically around
To see Caffrey rising from his seat
I shot that mother fucker down
Mmmmmmmmmm Yeah Yeah Yeah
"I have no free will", I sang
As I flew about the murder
Mrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed
You really should have heard her
I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept
I panted like a pup
I blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes
And her husband stupidly stood up
As he screamed, "You are an evil man"
And I paused a while to wonder
"If I have no free will then how can I
Be morally culpable, I wonder"
I shot Richard Holmes in the stomach
And gingerly he sat down
And he whispered weirdly, "No offense"
And then lay upon the ground
"None taken", I replied to him
To which he gave a little cough
With blazing wings I neatly aimed
And blew his head completely off
I've lived in this town for thirty years
And to noone I am a stranger
And I put new bullets in my gun
Chamber upon chamber
And I turned my gun on the birdlike Mr. Brookes
I thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows
And as I shot down the youthful Richardson
It was St. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows
I said, "I want to introduce myself
And I am glad that all you came"
And I leapt upon the bar
And shouted out my name
Well Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool
Closed his eyes and shrugged and laughed
And with an ashtray as big as a fucking really big brick
I split his head in half
His blood spilled across the bar
Like a steaming scarlet brook
And I knelt at it's edge on the counter
Wiped the tears away and looked
Well, the light in there was blinding
Full of God and ghosts of truth
I smiled at Henry Davenport
Who made an attempt to move
Well, from the position I was standing
The strangest thing I ever saw
The bullet entered through the top of his chest
And blew his bowels out on the floor
Well I floated down the counter
Showing no remorse
I shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter
But remorse i felt and remorse I had
It clung to every thing
From the raven's hair upon my head
To the feathers on my wings
Remorse sqeezed my hand in it's fradulent claw
With it's golden hairless chest
And I glided through the bodies
And killed the fat man Vincent West
Who sat quietly in his chair
A man become a child
And I raised the gun up to his head
He made no attempt to resist
So fat and dull and lazy
"Did you know I lived in your street?" I said
And he looked at me as though I were crazy
"O", he said, "I had no idea"
And he grew as quiet as a mouse
And the roar of the pistol when it went off
Near blew that hat right off the house
Hmmmmmm Uh Uh
Well, I caught my eye in the mirror
And gave it a long and loving inspection
"There stands some kind of man", I roared
And there did, in the reflection
My hair combed back like a raven's wing
My muscles hard and tight
And curling from the business end of my gun
Was a querymark of cordite
Well I spun to the left, I spun to the right
And I spun to the left again
"Fear me! Fear me! Fear me!"
But no one did cause they were dead
And then there were the police sirens wailing
And a bullhorn squelched and blared
"Drop your weapons and come out
With your hands held in the air"
Well, I checked the chamber of my gun
Saw I had one final bullet left
My hand, it looked almost human
As I raised it to my head
"Drop your weapon and come out!
Keep your hands above your head!"
I had one one long hard think about dying
And did exactly what they said
There must have been fifty cops out there
In a circle around O'Malley's bar
"Don't shoot", I cried, "I'm a man unarmed!"
So they put me in their car
And they sped me away from that terrible scene
And I glanced out of the window
Saw O'Malley's bar, saw the cops and the cars
And I started counting on my fingers
Aaaaaah One Aaaaaah Two Aaaaaah Three Aaaaaaah Four
O'Malley's bar O'Malley's bar
Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darting one
The cleaners are coming, one by one
You don't even want to let them start
They are knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts
Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning
We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal dear
It's round about, it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
They're lining up to inspect you
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that was lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
Hey, little train! Wait for me!
I once was blind but now
I see Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?
Hey little train! Wait for me!
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see
In this process of elimination
Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation
Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
I've searched the holy books
I tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviour
I've read the poets and the analysts
Searched through the books on human behaviour
I travelled this world around
For an answer that refused to be found
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
I loved her then and I guess I love her still
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in
She lives in my blood and skin
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair
Her winter lips as cold as stone
Yeah, I was her man
But there are some things love won't allow
I held her hand but I don't hold it now
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
This is her dress that I loved best
With the blue quilted violets across the breast
And these are my many letters
Torn to pieces by her longfingered hand
I was her cruelhearted man
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down
She's moving through me, even now
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
She's nobody's baby now
Nobody's baby now
She's nobody's baby now
Sapped and stupid I lie upon the stones and I swoons
The darlig little dandelions have done their thing and changed from suns into moons
The dragons roam the shopping malls, I hear they're gonna eat our guts
If I had the strength I might pick up my sword and make some attempt to resist
Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
Get ready to shield yourself
On the night of the lotus eaters
Mmm, don't you love my baby
Mmm, and don't you love my baby anymore
They gilded my scales, they fishbowled me and they toured me round the old aquariums
They come in their hordes to tap at the glass, the philistines and barbarians
I like floating here, it's nice, they've hung seaweed around my hips
And I do the hula for the hungry ones and the lames all throw me tips
Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
Get ready to shield yourself
On the night of the lotus eaters
Mmm, don't you love my baby
Mmm, and don't you love my baby anymore
Get ready to shield yourself
From our catastrophic leaders
Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
On the night of the lotus eaters
Now hit the streets!
Now hit the streets!
One morn I awakened
A new sun was shining
The sky was a Kingdom
All covered in blood
The moon and the stars
Where the troops that lay conquered
Like fruit left to wither
Poor spiritual food
And the spears of bright sun
All brave with it conquest
Did hover unearthly
In banners of fire
I kneit in the garden
Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes
Thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood
There'll be no sadness
There'll be no sorrow
There'll be no road too narrow
There'll be a new day
And it's today
I was just a boy when I sat down
To watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now
And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
She moves something deep inside of me
I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention
And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look
You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion,
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek
She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
and through the years
Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again
She moves among the sparrows
And she walks across the sea
She moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me
She moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
And she moves right up close to me
Mary, grab the baby, the river's rising
Muddy water taking back the land
The oldframe house, she can't takea one more beating
Ain't no use to stay and make a stand
Well the morning light shows water in the valley
Daddy's grave just went below the line
Things to say, you just can't take em with ya
This flood will swallow all you've left behind
Won't be back to start all over
Cause what I felt before is gone
Mary, take the child, the river's rising
Muddy water taking back my home
The road is gone, there's just one way to leave here
Turn my back on what I've left below
Shifting land, broken farms around me
Muddy water's changing all I know
It's hard to say just what I'm losing
Ain't never felt so all alone
Mary, take the child, the river's rising
Muddy water taking back my home
Won't be back to start all over
Cause what I felt before is gone
Mary, take the child, the river's rising
Muddy water's changing all I know
Muddy water's changing all I know
Lord, this muddy water is taking back my home
I walk into the corner of my room, see my friends in high places
I don't know which is which and whom is whom, they've stolen each other's faces
Janet is there with her highhatting hair full of bedroom feathers
Janet is known to make dead men groan in any kind of weathers
I crawl over to her, I say hey baby, I say hey Janet
You are the one, you are the sun and I'm your dutyfull planet
But she ain't down with any of that, she's heard that shit before
I say ah ha, oh yeah, you're right, cause I see Betty X standing by the door
With more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah, it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
Now, Betty X is like Betty Y minus that fatal chromosome
Her hair is like the wine dark sea, on which sailors come home
I say hey baby, I say hey Betty X I lean close up to her throat
This light you're carrying is like a lamp, hanging from a distant boat
It is my light, said Betty X, Betty X says this light ain't yours
And so much wind blew through her words that I went rolling down the hall
For more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah, it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
I turn another corner, I go down a corridor and I see this guy
He must be about 100 foot tall and he only has one eye
He asks me for my autograph, I write nobody and then
I wrap myself up in my woolly coat and blind him with my pen
Cause someone must have put something in my drink, everything getting strange looking
Half the people had turned into squealing pigs, the other half were cooking
Let me out of here, I cried, and I went pushing past
And I saw miss Polly singing with some girls, I cried strap me to the mast
For more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah, it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
Then a black girl with no clothes on danced across the room
We charted the progress of the planets around that boogiewongie moon
I called her my nubian princess, I gave her some sweetback badass jive
I spent the next seven years between her legs pining for my wife
But by and by it all went wrong, I felt all washedup on the shore
She stared down at me from up in the storm as I sobbed upon the floor
For more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And don't it make you feel alone
Don't it make you wanna get righton home
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
Here comes Alina with two black eyes, she's given herself a transfusion
She's filled herself with panda blood to avoid all the confusion
I said the sun rises and falls with you, and various things about love
But a rising violence in me cut all my circuits off
Well, Alina, she starts screaming, her cheeks are full of psychotropic leaves
Her extinction was nearly absolute when she turned her back on me
For more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah, it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
I bumped bang crash into Deanna hanging pretty in the door frame
Alle the horrors which have befallen me, well, Deanna is to blame
Every time I see you, babe, you make me feel so all alone
And I wept my face into her dress long after she'd gone home
With more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And don't it make you feel alone
Don't it make you wanna get right back home
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
Don't it make you feel so sad, don't the blood rush to your feet
To think that everything you do today, tomorrow is obsolete?
Technology and women and little children too
Don't it make you feel blue? Don't it make you feel blue?
For more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
And don't it make you feel alone
Don't it make you wanna get right back home
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere
Well, I've gotta say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When I came up from out of the meat locker
The city was gone
The sky was full of lights
The snow provided a silent cover
Under the stars
Under the snow
And I followed this car
And I followed that car
Through the sand
Through the snow
I turn on the radio
I listen to the DJ
And it must feel nice
It must feel nice
It must feel nice to know
That somebody needs you
And everything moves slow
Under the stars, under the ash, under the sand
And the night drifts in
The snow provided a silent cover
And I'm not your favourite lover
I turn on the radio
And it must feel nice
It must feel nice
Oh, very, very nice to know
That somebody needs you
And the chilly winds blow
Under the snow, under the stars
The whispering DJ on the radio
The whispering DJ on the radio
I'm not your favourite lover
I'm not your favourite lover
And it must feel nice
It must feel nice
To leave no trace
That somebody needs you
And that somebody is me
Under the stars, under the snow
Your eyes were closed
You were playing with the buttons on your coat
In the back of that car
Under the stars
And I followed that car
Hold that chrysalis in your palm, see it split and change
It won't do you any harm, it's just trying to rearrange
It was born to live a day, now it flies up from your hand
It's beautiful, it's the one they call your everloving man
Wolves have carried your babies away, oh your kids drip from their teeth
The nights are long and the day is bitter cold beyond belief
You spread yourself like a penitent upon the mad vibrating sand
And through your teeth arrange to meet your midnight man
Everybody's coming round to my place
Everybody's coming round to my place
Everybody's coming round, oh baby, don't you see
Everybody wanna be your midnight man
Don't disturb me as I sleep, treat me gently when I wake
Don't disturb me when I sleep even though your body aches
Even though your body aches to serve at his command
Between the wars she still adores her everloving man
Close your eyes, sleep in him, dream of your lost sons and daughters
Me, I'll raise up the dorsal fin, and glide up and down the waters
I'll glide up and down the waters, then I'll walk upon the land
And call them out, the ones who doubt your midnight man
Everybody's coming round to my place
Everybody's coming round to my place
Everybody's coming round, oh baby, don't you see
Everybody wants to be your midnight man
It's early in the morning and I don't know what to do
It's early in the morning and I can't believe it's true
It's early in the morning and it's happening again
I called you once, I called you twice, ain't I your midnight man?
Everybody's coming round to my place
Everybody's coming round to my place
Everybody's coming round, oh baby, don't you see
Everybody wants to be your midnight man
Everybody's coming round
Everybody's coming round
Everybody's coming round
To be your midnight man
To be your midnight man
I hope you're sitting comfortably
I saved you the best seat in the house
Right up in the front row
The stars have been torn down
The moon is locked away
And the land is banked in frozen snow
You are a forte of nature, dear
Your breath curls from your lips
As the trees bend down their branches
And touch you with their fingertips
They're bringing out the dead now
It's easy just to look away
They are bringing out the dead now
It's been a strange, strange day
We could navigate out position by the stars
But they've taken out the stars
The stars have all gone
I'm glad you've come along
We could comprehend our
condition by the moon
But they've ordered the the moon not to shine
Still, I 'm glad you've come along
I was worried out of my mind
Cause, they keep bringing out the dead
It's easy just to look away
They're bringing out the dead, now
And it's been a long, strange day
You can move up a little closer
I will throw a blanket over
We can weigh all the tears in one hand
Against the laughter in the other
We could be hanging around here for centuries
Trying to make sense of this, my dear
While the planets try to get organised
Way above the stratosphere
But they keep bringing out the dead, now
It's easy if we just walk away
They keep bringing out the dead, now
It's been a long, long day
I stood in the water
In the middle month of winter
My camel skin was torture
I was in a state of nature
The wind, sir, it was wicked
I was so alone
Just as I predicted
My followers were gone
And I cried Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I got down on my knees
Thrown into a dungeon
Bread and water was my portion
Faith  my only weapon
To rest the devil's legion
The speakhole would slide open
A viper's voice would plead
Thick with innuendo
Syphilis and Greed
And she cried Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I told her to get down on her knees
In a garden full of roses
My hands, tied behind me
My cousin was working miracles
I wondered if he'd find me
The moon was turned toward me
Like a platter made of gold
My death, it almost bored me
So often was it told
And I cried Mercy'
I cried mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Last night I lay trembling
The moon it was low
It was the end of love
Of misery and woe
The suddenly above me
Her face buried in light
Came a vision of beauty
All covered in white
Now the belltower is ringing
And the night has stole past
O Lucy, can you hear me?
Wherever you rest
I'll love her forever
I'll love her for all time
I'll love her till the stars
Fall down from the sky
Now the belltower is ringing
And I shake on the floor
O Lucy, can you hear me?
When I call and call
Now the belltower is ringing
And the moon it is high
O Lucy, can you hear me
When I cry and cry and cry
There's a devil waiting outside your door
How much longer?
There's a devil waiting outside your door
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
There's a devil waiting outside your door
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
There's a devil waiting outside your door
Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, Amen Till end of time Take off that
dress I'm coming down I'm your loverman

So help me, baby So help me
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
I'll be your loverman!
There's a devil crawling along your floor
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There's a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and
he's hungry and he's sore
And he's lame and he's blind
and he's dirty and he's poor
Give him more
There's a devil crawling along your floor
Loverman! Here I stand Forever, Amen

What I am what I am I'm your loverman!
There's a devil lying by your side
You might think he's asleep
but look at his eyes
He wants you, baby, to be his bride
There's a devil lying by your side
There she stands, this lovely creature
There she stands, there she stands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her hands
So I asked this lovely creature
Yes, I asked. Yes I asked
Would she walk with me a while
Through this night so fast
She took my hand, this lovely creature
"Yes", she said, "Yes", she said
"Yes, I'll walk with you a while"
It was a joyful man she led
Over hills, this lovely creature
Over mountains, over ranges
By great pyramids and sphinxs
We met drifters and strangers
Oh the sands, my lovely creature
And the mad, moaning winds
At night the deserts writhed
With diabolical things
Through the night, through the night
The wind lashed and it whipped me
When I got home, my lovely creature
She was no longer with me
Somewhere she lies, this lovely creature
Beneath the slow drifting sands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her hands
I hold this letter in my hand
A plea, a petition, a kind of prayer
I hope it does as I have planned
Losing her again is more than I can bear
I kiss the cold, white envelope
I press my lips against her name
Two hundred words. We live in hope
The sky hangs heavy with rain
Love Letter Love Letter
Go get her Go get her
Love Letter Love Letter
Go tell her Go tell her
A wicked wind whips up the hill
A handful of hopeful words
I love her and I always will
The sky is ready to burst
Said something I did not mean to say
Said something I did not mean to say
Said something I did not mean to say
It all came out the wrong way
Love Letter Love letter
Go get her Go get her
Love Letter Love letter
Go tell her Go tell her
Rain your kisses down upon me
Rain your kisses down in storms
And for all who'll come before me
In your slowly fading forms
I'm going out of my mind
Will leave me standing in
The rain with a letter and a prayer
Whispered on the wind
Come back to me
Come back to me
O baby please come back to me
Yeah, they came to take me away
Said I'd be sitting here for the rest of my life
But I don't really care  I shot my wife
And brother, I can't even remember the reason why
Oh, it makes a long time man feel bad
Yeah, it makes a long time man feel bad
Well I ain't had no love since I don't know when
It sure makes a long time man feel bad
We was down in Jacksonville
A cold winter night
My baby and I, we began to fight
I heated up, and I grabbed my gun
I get so cold on those nights down south
She was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor
She looked up at me and began to smile
Her gasping words "Baby, I love you"
Then she closed those baby blue eyes
Sometimes I hear you call my name in the dead of the night
I ain't had those arms around me
I ain't had those lips, those lips, around me
It sure makes a long time man feel bad
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
The judge he said Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near
She stood in the crowd but shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries on my bones
Janey's gone now and she won't be back no more.
It was only yesterday I went knocking on her door.
Now she's gone away.
We won't see her no more.
Little Janey's gone now, Janey's gone now,
Janey's gone now, Janey's gone.
Little Janey's gone now, Janey's gone now,
Janey is gone away.
Oh, yes, she is gone away.
Oh, man, that's for sure.
Little Janey's gone now, Janey's gone now,
Janey's gone away.
Janey's gone, oh people,
Oh, Lord, little Janey is gone.
She was the only one that we all could dip in ?
And now she's gone away.
We won't see her 'round here no more.
Little Janey's gone now, Janey's gone now,
Janey's gone now, Janey's gone.
Little Janey's gone now, Janey's gone now,
Janey's gone away.
Oh, yes, she is gone away.
Oh, man, that's for sure.
Little Janey's gone now, Janey's gone now,
Janey's gone away.
Janey's gone now and she won't be back no more.
We'll have to find some other place to go and score
'Cause now she's gone, don't you see,
They're gonna to throw way away the key.
'Cause little Janey's gone down, Janey's gone down,
Janey's gone down, Janey's gone.
Little Janey's gone down, Janey's gone down,
Janey's gone away.
Please forgive me
it's impossible to say
if I appear unkind
it's impossible to know but any fool can tell you,
it's all in your mind
Down in the meadow,
the old lion stirred
as his hands cross his mouth,
he has no use for word
Poor little girl,
with your hands full of snow.
Poor little girl,
'had no way to know
. But you've got me eatin'
you've got me eatin' out
you've got me eatin'
right outta your hands
or the frozen field
and the hollyhocks hang harmlessly
and the old lion ?
But you've got me eatin'
you've got me eatin'
you've got me eatin' right outta your hands
you've got me eatin' right outta your hands
got me eatin' right outta your hands
got me eatin' right outta your hands
got me eatin' right outta your hands
You found me at some party
You thought I'd understand
You barreled over to me
With a drink in each hand
I respect your beliefs, girl,
And I consider you a friend,
But I've already been born once,
I don't wanna to be born again.
Your knowledge is impressive
And your argument is good
But I am the resurrection, babe,
And you're standing on my foot!
But my little boat is empty
It don't go
And my oar is broken
It don't row, row, row
But my little boat is empty
It don't go
And my oar is broken
It don't row, row, row
Your tiny little face
Keeps yapping in the gloom
Seven steps behind me
With your dustpan and broom.
I couldn't help but imagine you
All postured and prone
But there's a little guy on my shoulder
Says I should go home alone.
You keep leaning in on me
And you're looking pretty pissed
That grave you've dug between your legs
Is hard to resist.
But my little boat is empty
It don't go
And my oar is broken
It don't row, row, row
But my little boat is empty
It don't go
And my oar is broken
It don't row, row, row
Give to God what belongs to God
And give the rest to me
Tell our gracious host to fuck himself
It's time for us to leave.
But my little boat is empty
It don't go
And my oar is broken
It don't row, row, row
But my little boat is empty
It don't go
And my oar is broken
It don't row, row, row
The boatman calls from the lake
A lone dives upon the water
I put my hand over hers
Down in the lime tree arbour
The wind in the trees is whispering
Whispering low that I love her
She puts her hand over mine
Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every breath that I breathe
And every place I go
There is a hand that protects me
And I do love her so
There will always be suffering
It flows through life like water
I put my hand over hers
Down in the lime tree arbour
The boatman he has gone
And the loons have flown for cover
She puts her hand over mine
Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every word that I speak
And every thing I know
There is hand that protects me
And I do love her so
Well, you lost a foe
And found yourself a friend
Lie down here  be my girl
I'm back now, baby, that man
He won't be coming round here again
Lie down here  be my girl
I'm trying to tread careful, baby
You're as brittle as the wishbone of a bird
Lie down here  be my girl
We've been scribbled in the margins of a story
That's patently absurd
Lie down here  be my girl
And let it all come down tonight
We can shine, shine
Let it all come down
Be my girl, be my girl
It's a matter of some urgency, oh darling, can't you see
I can't hold back the tide
Lie down here  be my girl
And stop your frantic little fingers trying to collect the years
That pour from the hole in my side
Lie down here  be my girl
Oh, don't worry, baby, this old snake banging on your door
Has got a few skins left to shed
Lie down here  be my girl
Oh, you look so good, you look so good
The rest is better left unsaid
Lie down here  be my girl
And let it all come down tonight
And shine, oh, we can shine
Let it all come down
Be my girl, yeah, be my girl
You look so good, you look so good
One day I'll buy a factory
And assemble you on a production line
Lie down here  be my girl
I'd buy a million of you, baby
And every single one of them will be mine
Lie down here  be my girl
I will fill the house with you, stack you up in every room
We'll have a real good time
Lie down here  be my girl
But right now, I'm sitting here on my own
Going out of my mind
Lie down here  be my girl
And let it all come down tonight
And shine, oh, we can shine
Let it all come down
You look so good, you look so good
C'mon, kind Sir, let's walk outside
And breathe the autumn air
See the many that have lived and died
See the unending golden stair
See all of us that have come behind
Clutching at your hem
All the way from Arkansas
To your sweet and last amen
Let the bells ring
He is the real thing
Let the bells ring
He is the real, real thing
Take this deafening thunder down
Take this bread and take this wine
Your passing is not what we mourn
But the world you left behind
Well, do not breathe, nor make a sound
And behold your mighty work
That towers over the uncaring ground
Of a lesser, darker world
Let the bells ring
He is the real thing
Let the bells ring
He is the real, real thing
There are those of us not fit to tie
The laces of your shoes
Must remain behind to testify
Through an elementary blues
So, let's walk outside, the hour is late
Through your crumbs and scattered shells
Where the awed and the mediocre wait
Barely fit to ring the bells
Let the bells ring
He is the real thing
Let the bells ring
He is the real, real thing
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Ah let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Ah let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
They're gonna lay me low Lay me low
They're gonna sink me in the snow
They're gonna throw back their heads and crow
When I go
They're gonna jump and shout Lay me low
They're gonna wave their arms about
All the stories will come out
When I go
All the stars will glow bright Lay me low
And my friends will give up the fight
They'll see my work in a different light
When I go
They'll try telephoning my mother Lay me low
But they'll end up getting my brother
Who'll spill the story on some longgone lover
That I hardly know
Hats off to the man
On top of the world
Come crawl up here, baby
And I'll show you how it works
If you wanna be my friend
And you wanna repent
And you want it all to end
And you wanna know when
Well do it now don't care how
Take your final bow
Make a stand Take my hand
And blow it all to hell
They gonna inform the police chief Lay me low
Who'll breathe a sigh of relief
He'll say I was a malanderer, a badlander, and a thief
When I go
They will interview my teachers Lay me low
Who'll say I was one of God's sorrier creatures
There'll print informative sixpage features
When I go
They'll bang a big old gong Lay me low
The motorcade will be ten miles long
The world will join together for a farewell song
When they put me down below
They'll sound a fluegelhorn Lay me low
And the sea will rage, and the sky will storm
All man and beast will mourn
When I go
Hats off to the man
On top of the world
Come crawl up here, baby
And we can watch this damn thing turn
If you wanna be my friend
And you wanna repent
And you want it all to end
And you wanna know when
Well do it now Do it now
Take a long last bow
Take my hand Make a stand
And blow it all to hell
Lay me low...
When I go...
I've seen your fairground hair,
your seaside eyes
Your vampire tooth, your little truth
Your tiny lies
I know your trembling hand, your guilty prize
Your sleeping limbs, your foreign hymns
Your midnight cries
So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away
I know your trail of tears, your slip of hand
Your monkey paw, your monkey claw
And your monkey hand
I've seen your trick of blood, your trap of fire
Your ancient wound, your scarlet moon
And your jailhouse smile
So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away
I'll miss your urchin smile, your orphan tears
Your shining prize, your tiny cries
Your little fears
I'll miss your fairground hair, your seaside eyes
Your vampire tooth, your little truth
And your tiny lies
So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away
I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
"Oh Willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die"
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, "Dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?"
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleading in my nose
I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me
They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail
I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl
The girl I loved so well
These chains of sorrow, they are heavy, it is true
And these locks cannot be broken,
no, not with one thousand keys
O Jailer, you wear a ballnchain you cannot see
You can lay your burden on me
You can lay your burden down on me
You can lay your burden down upon me
But you cannot lay down those memories.
Woooo wooo wooo
Woooo wooo wooo
Here I go!
Knockin on Joe!
This square foot of sky will be mine til I die
Knocking on Joe
Woooo wooo wooo
All down the row.
Knockin on Joe.
O Warden I surrender you
Your fists cain't hurt me anymore
You know, these hands will never wash
These dirty Death Row floors
O Preacher, come closer, you don't scare me anymore
Just tell Nancy not to come here
Just tell her not to come here anymore
Tell Nancy not to come
And let me die in the memory of her arms.
O woo woo woo
Woo woo woo
All down the row.
Knockin on Joe.
O you kings of halls and ends of halls
You will die within these walls
And I'll go, all down the row
Knockin on Joe.
O Nancy's body is a coffin,
she wears my tombstone at her head
O Nancy's body is a coffin,
she wears my tombstone at her head
She wears her body like a coffin
She wears a dress of gold and red
She wears a dress of gold and red
She wears a dress of red and gold
Gravelooters at my coffin
before my bodies even cold.
It's a door for when I go
Knockin on Joe
These hands will never mop
your dirty Death Row floors
No! You can hide! You can run!
O but your trial is yet to come
O you can run! You can hide!
But you have yet to be tried!
You can lay your burden down here
You can lay your burden down here
Knockin on Joe
You can lay your burden upon me
You can lay your burden down upon me
Knockin on Joe
You cain't hurt me anymore
Knockin on Joe.
Can you turn me up a bit?
Well frog went acourtin' and he did ride
With a sword and a pistol by his side And he rode 'til he came to Miss Mouse's door
And then he knelt right down upon the floor
He said, "Little Miss Mouse, will you marry me
Way down yonder in the hollow tree
With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee?"
Shoop shoop, shoop shoop
Miss Mouse had suitors, three or four
And they came rushing through the door
Well they grabbed Miss Mouse and began to fight
In the hollow tree it was a terrible night
Yeah, "Little Miss Mouse, will you marry me
Way down yonder in the hollow tree
With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee?"
Mr Frog threw her suitors to the floor
And with his sword and his pistol he killed them all
And they went to the vicar the very next day
And they left on their honeymoon right away
Oh glory, glory, glory be
Way down yonder in the hollow tree
With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee
Well the night was deep and the night was dark
And I was at the old dancehall on the edge of town
Some big ceremony was going down
Dancers writhed and squirmed and then,
Came apart and then writhed again
Like squirming flies on a pin
In the heat and in the din
Yes, in the heat and in the din
I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad John Finn
Well, midnite came and clock did strike
And in she came, did John Finn's wife
With legs like scissors and butcher's knives
A tattooed breast and flaming eyes
And a crimson carnation in her teeth
Carving her way through the dance floor
And I'm standing over by the bandstand
Every eye gaping on John Finn's wife
Yeah, every eye gaping on John Finn's wife
Now John Finn's wife was something of a mystery
In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty
I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife
Over near the bandstand with John Finn's wife
She got perfumed breasts and raven hair
Sprinkled with wedding confettis
And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares
Armed, as they were, with machetes
And the night through the window was full of lights
Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife
Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife
Next came the cops, all out on the town
But it don't look like no trouble there
As they had for the bar in their lumpy suits
And I slip my hand between the things of John Finn's wife
And they seemed to yawn awake, her things
It was a warm and very ferocious night
The moon full of blood and light
And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight
As I plotted in the ear of John Finns' wife
Enter John Finn in his shrunken suit
With his quick black eyes and black cheroot
With his filleddown teeth and a hobnail boot
And his fists full of pistols in his pockets
Aiming at me and aiming at his wife
The band fall silent fearing for their lives
And with fear in my guts like tangled twine
Cause all I got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife
And mad John Finns' wife is all
And the three of us walk out of the hall
Now the night bore down upon us all
You could hear the crickets in the thickets call
And guns did flare and guns did bawl
And I planted my bolo knife in the neck
Of mad John Finn. I took his wretched life
Now I'm over near the bandstand
Every hand moving on John Finns' wife
Every hand moving on John Finns' wife
And John Finns' wife
Took all the flowers down
From her hair
And threw them on the ground
And the flies did hum
And the flies did buzz around
Poor John Finn
Lying dead upon the ground
Lying dead upon the ground
I stepped out of the St. James Hotel, I'd left you behind curled up like a child
A change is gonna come, and as the door whispered shut
I walked on down the highwindowed hall
You lay sleeping on the unmade bed, the weatherman on the television
In the St. James Hotel said that the rains are gonna come
And I stepped out on the streets all sparkling clean with the early morning dew
Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?
You came on like a punch in the heart
You lying there with the light on your hair
like a Jesus on the moon
A Jesus of the planets and the stars
Well, I kept thinking about what the weatherman said
And if the voices of the living can be heard by the dead
Well, the day is gonna come when we find out
And in some kinda way I take a little comfort from that now and then
Cause people often talk about being scared of change
But for me I'm more afraid of things staying the same
Cause the game is never won by standing in any one place for too long
Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?
But there was a chord in you I could not find to strike
You lying there with all the light in your hair like a Jesus of the moon
A Jesus of the planets and the stars
I see the many girls walking down the empty streets
And maybe once or twice one of them smiles at me
You can't blame anyone for saying hello
I say hey, I say hello, I say hello
Will it be me or will it be you?
One must stay and one depart
You lying there in a St. James Hotel bed
Like a Jesus of the moon
A Jesus of the planets and the stars
I say hello, hello, hello
Jesus met the woman at the well
Jesus met the woman at the well
And he told her, everything that she'd done, that she'd done
And he said, woman, looka here woman,
Tell me where is your husband?
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't have one
He said, woman, looka here woman,
They tell me you have five husbands
And that man you have now sure ain't one
She went running, crying, God help me
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you must be the prophet
Because you told me everything that I've done
Goes Yackety Yack
Visits the home of the brave
Hails a fat yellow cab
Jack wanna celebrate
Jack wanna big drink
Driver drops him at a bar
Called the Rinky Dink
Jack pushes through the door
And crosses the floor
Tips his hat to a man
Grinning in the corner
Going Do da do Do da do
Says, I'm Jangling Jack
I go Do da do
I wanna Rinky Dink Special
I wanna little umbrella too
Jack flops on his stool
Sees the grinning man laugh
So Jack laughs back
Jack raises his glass
Says, God bless this country
And everything in it
The losers and the winners
The good guys and the sinners
The grinning man says, Buddy
It's all Yackety Yack
Whips out a little black pistol
Shoots a bullet in Jack
Do Da Do Do Da Do
How do you Do Da Do
Jangling Jack Flies off his seat
Crashes through the door
Lands in a heap on the street
Hears his mother's voice
Going, Do do do
Jack is shouting
Mummy is that you?
He sees the berserk city
Sees the dead stacked in piles
Sees the screaming crowd
Screams, Where am I?
Going Do da do Going Do da do
Well Jangling Jack
As a matter of fact
Crawls through the crowd
Back into the bar
Jack crawls to his stool
Jack drags himself up
Falls back down on his arse
In a puddle of blood
Going Goodbye Mummy
Jack doubles over
And he vomits and dies
Going Do do do Going Do do do
They dragged Jack and his shadow
From the hole
And the bulb that burned above him
Did shine both day and night
And his shadow learned to love his
Little darks and greater light
And the sun it shined
And the sun it shined
And the sun it shined
A little longer
Jack wept and kissed his shadow
Spat from their dirty dungeons
Into a truly different din
Shat from their institutions
Into a fully different din
And his shadow soon became a wife
And children plagued his latter life
Until one night he took a skinning knife
And stole into the town
And tracked his shadow down
Said the shadow to Jack Henry
Jack said "A home is not a hole"
"And shwdow, you're just a gallow that I hang my body from"
"O Shadow, your a shackle from wich my time is never done"
Then he peeled his shadow off in strips
He peeled his shadow off in strips
Then kneeled his shadow on some steps
And cried "What have I done?"
And the sun it shined
And the sun it shined
I say "Love is blind"
"And is it any wonder?!"
"And is it any wonder?!"
Jacked and his damned shadow
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn
'Tis done in brighter corners now
'Tis done in brighter corners now
Now that Jack's black shadow's gone
And the sun it shined
And the sun it shined
And the sun it shined
A little stronger
I swear, love is blind
Ooh, love is blind
Yeah, love is blind
And is it any wonder?
'Tis done in brighter corners now
'Tis done in brighter corners now
Now that Jack's black shadow's gone
I got a woman
SHe rules my house with an iron fist
I got a woman
She rules my house with an iron fist
She screams out Jack the Ripper
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss
I got a woman
She strikes me down with a fist of lead
I got a woman
She strikes me down with a fist of lead
We bed in a bucket of butcher's knives
A awake with a hatchet hanging over my head
Well you know the story of the viper
It's long and lean with poison tooth
Yeah, you know the story of the viper
It's long and lean with poison tooth
Well they're hissing under the floorboards
Hanging down in bunches from my roof
I got a woman
She just hollers what she wants from where she is
I got a woman
She just hollers what she wants from where she is
She screams out Jack the Ripper
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss
I don't believe in an interventionist God
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Not to touch a hair on your head
To leave you as you are
And if He felt He had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms
And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder if that's true
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch over you
To each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms
And I believe in Love
And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candlew burning
And make her journey bright and pure
That she will keep returning
Always and evermore
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms
As the snow flies
On a cold and grey Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto
Oh people don't you understand
This child needs a helping hand
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we that blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?
And the world turns
And the hungry little boy with the runny nose
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun and steals a car
He tries to run but he don't get far
And his mama cries
A crowd gathers round an angry young man
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
And as her young man dies
On a cold and grey Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born in the ghetto
They're taking me down, my friend
And as they uskher me off to my end
Will I bid you adieu?
Or will I be seeing you soon?
If what they say around here is true
Then we'll meet again
Me and you
My time is at hand, my dove
They're gunna pass me to that house above
Is Heaven just for victims, dear?
Where only those in pain go?
Well it takes two to tango
We will meet again, my love
If you're in Heaven then you'll forgive me, dear
Because that's what they do up there
If you're in Hell, then what can I say
You probably deserved in anyway
I guess I'm gunna find out any day
For we'll meet again
And there'll be Hell to pay
Your face comes to me from the depths, dear
Your silent mouth mouths, 'Yes", dear
Dark red and big with blood
They're gunna shut me down, my love
They're gunna launch me into the stars
Well, all things come to pass
This prayer is for you, my love
Sent on the wings of a dove
An idiot prayer of empty words
Love, dear, is strictly for the birds
We each get what we deserve
My little snow white dove
Yeah, my baby left me this morning
And I don't care now, I don't care what the people say
Yeah, I did everything that I could, everything I could,
Lord knows I did everything I could
I tried to satisfy her worried mind, that's what I did
You know she was nothing but trouble, trouble
She keep me worried all the time
God knows her movements are killing me
Yeah, my baby stayed out all night long, all night long
She keep me worried all the time
Yeah, I lay down last night I was thinking
Must I kill that woman? Must I kill that woman?
Oh Lord I get down on my knees
They tell me God forgivin' everything you do
But I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna kill that woman,
I'm gonna kill that woman, God knows
I'm gonna get down on my knees
Despair and Deception, Love's ugly little twins
Came aknocking on my door, I let them in
Darling, you're the punishment for all of my former sins
I let love in
I let love in
The door it opened just a crack, but Love was shrewed and bold
My life flashed before my eyes, it was a horror to behold
A lifesentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
Well I've been bound and gagged and I've been terrorized
And I've been castrated and I've been lobotomized
But never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
O Lord, tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here alone
Where are my friends?
My friends are gone
O Lord, tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here alone
Where are my friends?
My friends are gone
I let love in
I let love in
So if you're sitting all alone and hear aknocking at you door
and the air is full of promises, well buddy, you've been warned
Far worse to be Love's lover than the lover that Love has scorned
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream, Joe
I had a dream, Joe
You were standing in the middle of an open road
I had a dream, Joe
Your hands were raised up to the sky
And your mouth was covered in foam
I had a dream, Joe
A shadowy Jesus flitted from tree to tree
I had a dream, Joe
And a society of whores stuck needles in an image of me
I had a dream, Joe
It was Autumn time and thickly fell the leaves
And in that dream, Joe
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick
And pointed his finger at me
I had a dream,
I had a dream,
I had a dream, Joe
I opened my eyes, Joe
The night had been a giant, dribbling and pacing the boards
I opened my eyes, Joe
All your letters and cards stacked up against the door
I opened my eyes, Joe
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack
In the window, Joe
And I thought of you and I felt like I was lugging
A body on my back
I had a dream,
I had a dream,
I had a dream, Joe
Where did you go, Joe?
On that endless, senseless, demented drift
Where did you go, Joe?
Into the woods, into the trees, where you move and shift
Where did you go, Joe?
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit
Where did you go, Joe?
With that strew of wreckage
Forever at the heel of your boot
I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream, Joe
I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream, Joe
The boatman calls from the lake
A lone loon dives upon the water
I put my hand over her
Down in the lime tree arbour
The wind in the trees is whispering
Whispering low that I love her
She puts her hand over mine
Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every breath that I breathe
And every place I go
There is hand that protects me
And I do love her so
There will always be suffering
It flows through life like water
I put my hand over hers
Down in the lime tree arbour
The boatman he has gone
And the loons have flown for cover
She puts her hand over mine
Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every word that I speak
And every thing I know
There is hand that protects me
And I do love her so
I'm so far away from you
Pacing up and down my room
Does Jesus only love a man who loses?
I turn on the radio
There's some cat on the saxophone
Laying down a litany of excuses
There's madhouse longing in my baby's eyes
She rubs the lamp between her thighs
And hopes the genie comes out singing
She lives in some forgotten song
And moves like she is zombiestrong
Breathes steady as the pendulum keeps swinging
You better hold on to yourself
Well, cities rust and fall to ruin
Factories close and cars go cruising
In around the borders of her vision
She says ooh
As Jesus makes the flowers grow
All around the scene of her collision
You know I would, yes, I would
I would hold on to yourself
In the middle of the night
I try my best to chase outside
The phantoms and the ghosts and fairygirls
On 1001 nights like these
She mutters open sesame and Ali Baba and his forty thieves
Launch her off the face of the world
You know one day I'll come back and I'd hold on to yourself
To yourself, I'd hold on to yourself
Ooh baby, I'm a 1000 miles away
And I just don't know what to say
Cause Jesus only loves a man who bruises
But darling, we can clearly see
It's all life and fire and lunacy
And excuses and excuses and excuses
Well, you know if I could, I would
I'd lie right down and I'd hold on to yourself
Yeah, I would lie right down and I would hold on to yourself
One day I'll come back to you and I'd hold on to yourself
Yeah, I'm gonna come back, gonna lie down
And I would hold on to yourself
Yeah, to yourself
You went looking for nur, dear,
Down by the sea
You found some Iittle silver fish
But you didn't find me
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way
You went to the museum
You climbed a spiral stair
You searched for me all among
The knowledgeable air
I was hidden, babe, hiding all away
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away
You entered the cathedral
When you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the hell
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away
You asked an electrician
If he'd seen me round his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away
I was not there, dear, hiding all away
You went and asked your doctor
To get some advice
He shot you full of Pethidine
And then he billed you twice
But I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
But I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
You approached a high court judge
You thought he'd be on the level
He wrapped a rag around your face
And beat you with his gavel
I was hiding, habe, hiding all away
I was hidden, dem, hiding all away
You asked at the local constabulary
They said, he's up to his same old tricks
They leered at you with their baby blues
And rubbed jelly on their sticks
I had to get out of there, babe, hiding all away
I had to get out of there, dear, hiding all away
You searched through all my poets
From Sappho through to Auden
I saw the book fall from your hands
As you slowly died of boredom
I had been there, dear,
but I was not there anymore
I had been there, now I'm hiding all way
You walked into the ball of fame
And approached my imitators
Some were stuffing their faces with caviar
Some were eating cold potatoes
I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
You asked a famous cook if he'd seen me
He opened his oven wide
He basted you with butter, babe
And made you crawl inside
I was not in there, dear, hiding all away
I was not in there, dear, hiding all away
You asked the butcher
Who lifted up his cleaver
Stuck his fist up your dress
Said he must've been mad to leave you
But I had to get away, dear, hiding all away
I had to get away, dear, I was hidden all away
Some of us we hide away
Some of us we don't
Some will live to love another day
And some of us won't
But we all know there is a law
And that law, it is love
And we all know there's a war coming
Coming from above
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
I'm gonna shoot my baby, I caught her messin round with another man
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your baby down
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your baby down
Yes I did I shot her, I went and put her in the ground
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to now?
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to now?
I'm heading way down South where I can be free
I'm heading Mexico way, no hangman's about to put a leash around me
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
It's all right, it's all right
feat. PJ Harvey
Get down, get down, little Henry Lee
And stay all night with me
You won't find a girl in this damn world
That will compare with me
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
I can't get down and I won't get down
And stay all night with thee
For the girl I have in that merry green land
I love far better than thee
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
She leaned herself against a fence
Just for a kiss or two
And with a little penknife held in her hand
She plugged him through and through
And the wind did roar and the wind did moan
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
Come take him by his lillywhite hands
Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep deep well
Which is more than one hundred feet
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
Lie there, lie there, little Henry Lee
Till the flesh drops from your bones
For the girl you have in that merry green land
Can wait forever for you to come home
And the wind did howl and the wind did moan
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
In his boat and through the dark he rowed
Chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed
Horribly 'round his ears
Under the bridge and into your dreams he soars
While you lie alone in that ideafree sleep of yours
That you've been sleeping now for years
And he wants you
He wants you
He is straight and he is true
Ooh hoo hoo
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where
He will move, all amongst your tangled hair
And deep into the sea
And you will wake and walk and draw the blind
And feel some presence there behind
And turn to see what that may be
Oh, babe, it's me
And he wants you
He wants you
He is straight and he is true
Ooh hoo hoo
It is for she that the cherry bleeds
That the moon is steeped in mild nad blood
That I steal like a robber
From her altar of love
O money lender! O clover gender!
I am the fiend hid in her skirts
And it's as hot as hell in here
Coming at her as I am from above
Hard on for love hard on for love
Hard on for love hard on for love
Well, I swear I seen that girl before
Like she walked straight outa the book of Leveticus
But they can stone me with stones I don't care
Just as long as I can get to kiss
Those gypsy lips! Gypsy lips!
My aim is to hit this Miss
And I'm moving in I'm moving in
Coming at her like Lazarus from above
Hard on for love hard on for love
Hard on for love hard on for love
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want
But he ledeth me like a lamb to the lips
Of the mouth of the valley of the whadow of death
I am his rod and his staff
I am his sceptre and shaft
And she is heaven and hell
At whose gates I ain't been delivered
I'm gunna give the gates a shove
Hard on for love hard on for love
Hard on for love hard on for love
And her breasts rise and fall
Breast rise and fall
Breast rise and fall
Breast rise and fall
And just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
You are beautiful! O dove!
Hard on for love hard on for love
Hard on for love hard on for love
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Her breasts rise and fall
Her breasts rise and fall
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her
Hard on for love hard on for love
Hard on for love hard on for love
On the first day of May I took to the road
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning As a warning
As a warning
I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared.
I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud Like a shroud
Like a shroud
There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, "Why don't you come in here?"
"You looked soaked to the skin"
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin
I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation That invitation
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home
Singing my song
The tears are welling in my eyes again
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
And twenty pretty girls to carry
And twenty deep holes to bury them in
The tears are welling in my eyes again
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
And twenty pretty girls to carry them down
And twenty deep holes to bury them in
Kiss me again, rekiss me and kiss me
Slip your frigid hands beneath my shirt
This useless old fucker with his twinkling cunt
Doesn't care if he gets hurt
Green eyes, Green eyes
Green eyes, Green eyes
If it were but a matter of faith
If it were measured in petitions and prayer
She would materialise, all fleshed out
But it is not, nor do I care
Green eyes, Green eyes
Green eyes, Green eyes
So hold me and hold me, don't tell me your name
This morning will be wiser than this evening is
Then leave me to my enemied dreams
And be quiet as you are leaving, Miss
Green eyes, Green eyes
Green eyes, Green eyes
Green eyes, Green eyes
See the little cloud up in the sky.
It's a good good day today.
See the little cloud pass on by.
It's a good good day today.
Mary comes now, let Mary be,
Can you see her down on the street?
Mary's laughing 'cause Mary sees
That she's awearin' that dress for me.
There can be times,
When no things come together,
Under a clear sky and you can believe,
You hold your breath for this moment,
But do not breathe for this day alone
Is a good day, yes I know,
It's a good day, yeah I know,
Hear her feet skipping up the stairs.
It's a good good day today.
She is the answer to all of my prayers.
It's a good good day today.
Mary comes now, she don't knock
'Cause she's runnin' on her own little clock
Mary's laughing 'cause Mary knows
That this day was meant for us.
And Mary full knows,
And any foresees that the future,
Is adown on its knees
And are all crying and areelin'
And tears roll down their cheeks
'Cause I can believe in the one
That is standing in front of me
On this day, don't you know,
Is a good day, yes I know,
It's a good day, I told you so,
See her breasts how they rise and fall,
It's a good good day today.
And she knows I've used that line before,
It's a good good day today.
Mary's laughing, she don't mind
'Cause she knows she's one of a kind.
Mary's laughing, just to me,
Standing next to me
And April knows,
That the wind always blows
Something to someone,
Once in a while, so let it rain,
Let it fall,
Let the wind, oh, through your door
'Cause right now for this moment
For ever me,
Standing next to her,
On this day, which I know
Is a good day, yeah I know
Oh, it's a good day, I told you so
We've laid the cables and the wires
We've split the wood and stoked
We've lit our town so there is no
Place for crime to hide
Our little church is painted white
And in the safety of the night
We all go quiet as a mouse
For the word is out
God is in the house
God is in the house
God is in the house
No cause for worry now
God is in the house
Moral sneaks in the White House
Computer geeks in the school house
Drug freaks in the crack house
We don't have that stuff here
We have a tiny little Force
But we need them of course
For the kittens in the trees
And at night we are on our knees
As quiet as a mouse
For God is in the house
God is in the house
God is in the house
And no one's left in doubt
God is in the house
Homos roaming the streets in packs
Queer bashers with tyrejacks
That stuff is for the big cities
Our town is very pretty
We have a pretty little square
We have a woman for a mayor
Our policy is firm but fair
Now that God is in the house
God is in the house
God is in the house
Any day now He'll come out
God is in the house
Wellmeaning little therapists
Goosestepping twelvestepping Tetotalitarianists
The tipsy, the reeling and the drop down pissed
We got no time for that stuff here
Zero crime and no fear
We've bred all our kittens white
So you can see them in the night
And at night we're on our knees
As quiet as a mouse
Since the word got out
From the North down to the South
For noone's left in doubt
There's no fear about
If we all hold hands and very quietly shout
God is in the house
God is in the house
Oh I wish He would come out
God is in the house
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready tot love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Get readyl
Well, most of all nothing much
ever really happens
And God rides high up in the ordinary sky
Until we find ourselves at out most distracted
And the miracle that was promised
creeps quietly by
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
The mighty wave their hankies from their
Sending grief and joy down in supportable doses
And we search high and low without
merty or malice
While the gate to the Kingdom swings
shut and closes
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Praise Him till you've forgotten
what you're praising Him for
Praise Him till you've forgotten
what you're praising Him for
Then praise Him a little bit more
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more
Praise Him till you've forgotten
what you're praising Him for
Praise Him tillyou've forgotten what
you're praising Him for
Praise Him a little bit more
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Get ready!
I searched the seven seas and I've looked
under the carpet
And browsed through the brochures
that govern the skies
Then I was just hanging around, doing
nothing und looked up to see
His face burned in the retina of your eyes
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Past the ivycovered windows of
Down Athenaeum Lane to the cathedral
Through the churchyard I wandered
Sat for a spell there and I pondered
My back to the gates of the garden
My back to the gates of the garden
My back to the gates of the garden
Fugitive fathers, sickly infants, decent mothers
Runaways and suicidal lovers
Assorted boxes of ordinary bones
Of aborted plans and sudden shattered hopes
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden
In unhappy rows, up to the gates of the garden
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
To the garden
Beneath the creeping shadow of the tower
The bell from St. Edmunds informs me of the hour
I turn to find you waiting there for me
In sunlight and I see the way that you breathe
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Leave these ancient places to the angels
Let the saints attend to their keeping of the cathedrals
And leave the dead beneath the ground so cold
For God is in this hand that I hold
As we open up the gates of the garden
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
To the garden
Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
You kno, she lives in Apt. 29
Why... that's the one right up top a mine
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry
O ah hear her walkin
Walkin barefoot cross the floorboards
All thru this lonesome night
And ah hear her crying too.
Hottears come splashin on down
Leaking thru the cracks,
Down upon my face, ah catch'em in my mouth!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Ah read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizin every lil piece of dirt
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt
Fled outa the window,
And shinning it down the vine
Outa her nightmare, and back into mine
Mine! O Mine!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Cry! Cry! CRY!
She's wearing them bloostockens, ah bet!
and standin like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen ah kno it must sound absurd
but ah can hear the most melancholy sound
ah ever heard!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
O tell me why? Why? Why?
Why the ceiling still shakes?
Why the fixtures turn to serpants snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound
and its naggin at me like a shrew
but, ah kno, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her.
O o o then ya kno, that lil girl would just have to go!
Go! Gooo! From her to eternity!
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz
Que um dia
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus
Foi na cruz

Love comes aknocking
Comes aknocking upon our door
But you, you and me, love
We don't live here any more
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz
Que um dia
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus
Foi na cruz
Que um dia
Foi na cruz
A little sleep, a little slumber
A little folding of the hands to sleep
A little love, a little hate, babe
A little trickery and deceit
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz
Que um dia
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus
Foi na cruz
Que um dia
Foi na cruz
Dream on 'till you can dream no more
For all our grand plans, babe
Will be dreams forever more
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz
Que um dia
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus
Foi na cruz
Que um dia
Foi na cruz
Where is Mona?
She's long gone
Where is Mary?
She's taken her along
But they haven't put their mittens on
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow?
Where is Michael?
Where is Mark?
Where is Mathew
Now it's getting dark?
Where is John? They are all out back
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Would you please put down that telephone
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow
I waved to my neighbour
My neighbour waved to me
But my neighbour
Is my enemy
I kept waving my arms
Till I could not see
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Out there please?
It's too quiet in here
And I'm beginning to freeze
I've got icicles hanging
From my knees
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Is there anybody here who feels this low?
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder?
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
I'm going mad
This is the worst day
I've ever had
I can't remember
Ever feeling this bad
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Where's my nurse
I need some healing
I've been paralysed
By a lack of feeling
I can't even find
Anything worth stealing
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Is there anyone else here who doesn't know?
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder?
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
For you dear, I was born
For you I was raised up
For you I've lived and for you I will die
For you I am dying now
You were my mad little lover
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over
You who are so far from me
Far from me
So far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea
Far from me
I would talk to you of all matter of things
With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face
And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes
I keep hearing that you're doing best
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast
You are so far from me
Far from me
Far from me
There is no knowledge but i know it
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime
It's good to hear you're doing so well
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell
Did you ever
Care for me?
Were you ever
There for me?
So far from me
You told me you'd stick by me
Through the thick and through the thin
Those were your very words
My fairweather friend
You were my bravehearted lover
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother
So far from me
Far from me
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea
Far from me
Far from me
Farmer Emmerich went into his barn
And found a cow suckling a serpent
And a brown ape clanking a heavy chain
Said Farmer Emmerich to the ape
Never ask me to come into this barn again
Farmer Emmerich caught the serpent
And the brown ape in a cage
And took them into his house
He fed the snake a vat of milk
And when the ape rattled its chain
He tossed the ape a mouse
The villagers found out that Farmer Emmerich
Was nurturing a serpent
And descended upon his farm
All rabid in their blindness
They dragged the snake outside
Chopped it open with an axe
And the ground soaked
In the milk of human kindness
But the brown ape escaped
And was heard to roam the ranges
Clanking its heavy chain
Down in the valley it sang to its friend
Whom he may never see again
Everything must converge,
And so it goes, by and by.
Everything must converge,
Somehow, some way...
Everything must converge,
Or so it seems and by and by,
Every little thing must converge,
By and by and so they say...
Like the river that runs to the sea,
Like the sun going down on me...
Everything must converge,
But I hope,
And I pray
That everything must converge,
For me and you
Like the river that runs to the sea
Like the sun going down on me.
Everything... must converge
Everything... must converge
It's difficult. It's very tough.
I said to the man who'd been sleeping rough
To sit within a fragrant breeze
All among the nodding trees
That hang heavy with the stuff
He threw his arms around my neck
He brushed the tear from my cheek
And held my soft white hand
He was an understanding man
He did not even barely hardly speak
Rain it down on the wife and the kids
Rain it down on the house where we live
Rain until you got nothing left to give
And rain that everloving stuff down on me
All the things for which my heart yearns
Gives joy in diminishing returns
He kissed me on the mouth
His hands they headed south
And my cheek it burned
Money, man, it is a bitch
The poor, they spoil it for the rich
With my face pressed in the clover
I wondered when this would be over
And at home we are all so guiltysad
Pour it down the open drain
Pour it all through my veins
Pour it down, yeah, let it rain
And pour that everloving stuff down on me
Now, I'm sitting pretty down on the bank
Life shuffles past at a low interest rate
In the moneycoloured meadows
And all the interesting shadows
They leap up, then dissipate
Rain it down on the wife and the kids
Rain it down on the house where we live
Rain it down until you got nothing left to give
And rain that everloving stuff down on me
Onward! And Onward! And Onward I go
Where no man before could be bothered to go
Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes
And it's all downhill with a bullet
This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course
I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces
Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit
The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled
And the coins in my pocket go jinglejangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
There's a man in the theatre with girlish eyes
Who's holding my childhood to ransom
On the screen there's a death,
there's a rustle of cloth
And a sickly voice calling me handsome
There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes
On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla
There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla
This is a secret, mauled and mangled
And the coins in my pocket go jinglejangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood
The lights go down, the red curtains come apart
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart
And the coins in my pocket jinglejangle
As the great screen crackled and popped
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped
And my handsome little body oddly propped
And my trousers ride down to my ankles
Yes, onward! And upward!
And I'm off to find love
Do you love me? If you do, I'm thankful
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
This city is an ogre squatting by the river
It gives life but it takes it away, my youth
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver
This is a fact. This is a stone cold truth.
Do you love me? I love you, handsome.
But do you love me? Yes, I love you, you are handsome
Amongst the cogs and the wires, my youth
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth
Memories that become monstrous lies
So onward! And Onward! And Onward I go!
Onward! And Upward! And I'm off to find love
With blueblack bracelets on my wrists and my ankles
And the coins in my pocket go jinglejangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'll love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On and endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jinglejangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our lovelines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jinglejangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
She had a heartful of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
bAnd the bells from the chapel go jinglejangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jinglejangle
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Back in that hole.
Larry made his nest high up in the autumn branches
Built from nothing but high hopes and thin air
He collected up some baby blasted mothers who took their chances
And for a while they lived quite happily up there
He came from New York city man, but he couldn't take the pace
He thought it was like dog eat dog world
Then he went to San Francisco, spent a year in outer space
With a sweet little San Fransiscan girl.
I can hear my mother wailing and a whole lot of scraping of chairs
I don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
I want you to dig Back in that hole.
I want you to dig
I want you to dig
Yeh, New York City he had to get out of there and San Francisco well,
I don't know and then to LA where he spent about a day
he thought even the pale sky stars were smart enough to keep well away from LA
Meanwhile Larry made up names for the ladies
Like miss Boo and miss Quick
He stockpiled weapons and took potshots in the air
He feasted on their lovely bodies like a lunatic
And wrapped himself up in their soft yellow hair
I can hear chants and incantations and some guy is mentioning me in his prayers.
Well, I don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
I want you to dig Back in that hole.
I want you to dig
I want you to dig Well New York City man, San Francisco, LA, I don't know
But Larry grew increasingly neurotic and obscene
I mean he, he never asked to be raised from the tomb
I mean no one ever actually asked him to forsake his dreams
Anyway to cut a long story short, fate finally found him
Mirrors became his torturers, cameras snapped him at every chance
The women all went back to their homes and their husbands with secret smiles in the corner of their mouthes
He ended up like so many of them do, back on the streets of New York City
In a soup queue, a dope fiend, a slave, then prison, then the madhouse, then the grave
Ah poor Larry.
But what do we really know of the dead And who actually cares?
Well, I don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs. Dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
I want you to dig
Back in that hole Dig yourself
When you're sad and when you're lonely
And you haven't got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When you're standing on the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don't know what's up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When the storm clouds gather round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there's noone there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
For the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation
Up in dark and empty skies
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
When you search in vain to find
Some lawabiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
You know you are my friend, yeah
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul
No carpet on the floor
And the winding cloth holds many moths
Around your Ku Klux furniture
I cum of deathhead in your frock
We discuss the murder plan
We discuss murder and the murder act
Murder takes the wheel of your Cadillac
And death climbs in the back
This is a car
This is a gun
And this a day number one
Our little crimeworn histories
Black and smoking christmas trees
And honey, it ain't mystery
Why you're a mystery to me
We will eat out of their pantries
And their parlours
Ashy leaving in their beds
And we'll unload into their heads
On this mean season
This little angel that I squeezin'
She ain't been mean to me
You are my friend and my partner
On this house on the hill
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul
I am aknocking
With my toolbox and my stocking
And I'll meet you on the corner
Yes, you point it like a finger
And squeeze its little thing
Feel its kick, hear its bang
And let no worry about its issue
Don't worry about where its been
and don't worry about where it hits
Cause it just ain't yours to sin
No it just ain't your to sin
And we ain't getting any younger
And I don't intend gettin' any older
The sun a hump at my shoulder
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love of money
I'm down here for your soul
She sat in a wicker chair, her eyes they were downcast
She breathed in the future, by breathing out the past
The die is done, the die is shook, the die is duly cast
There is a dead man in my bed, she said
That smile you see upon his face
It's been there for many days
There's a dead man in my bed
I ain't been feeling that good too much no more, she said, I swear
She pointed at the bedroom door and said I ain't going in there
She leaped out of her seat and screamed someone's not concentrating here
There is a dead man in my bed, she said
I ain't speaking metaphorically
His eyes are open but he cannot see
There's a dead man in my bed
The leaves outside the window waved, all brown, they were, and falling
Even I could tell the atmosphere in here was utterly appalling
The phone it rang incessantly but nobody was calling
There's a dead man in my bed, she said
And though he keeps on taking notes
I swear this ain't some kind of hoax
Dead man in my bed
Now she's in the kitchen, rattling those pots and pans
I'd cook him something nice, she said, but he refuses to wash his hands
He used to be so good to me, now he smells so fucking bad
There is a dead man in my bed, she said
I keep poking at him with my stick
But his skin is just so fucking thick
There's a dead man in my bed
We've gotta get it all together
We've gotta get it all together
We've gotta get it all together
We've gotta get it all together
As so with that, I thought I'd take a final walk
The tide of public opinion had started to abate
The neighbours, bless them, had turned out to be all talk
I could see their frightened faces
peering at me through the gate
I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope of keeping track of it
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure
And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it
And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street
I stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd
And love followed just behind me, panting at my feet
As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud
Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God
I searched through the pictures in a leatherbound book
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook
It seems so long
Since you've been gone away
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day
Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun
It was a Good day and an Evil day and all was bright and new
And it seemed to me that most destruction was being done
By those who could not choose between the two
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones
The streets groan with little Caesars, Napoleons and cunts
With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs down their fronts
I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers
The Magnolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands
Great cracks appear in the pavement, the earth yawns
Bored and disgusted, to do us down
It seems so long
Since you've been gone
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day
These streets are frozen now. I come and go
Full of a longing for something I do not know
My father sits slumped in the deepening snow
As I search, in and out, above, about, below
It seems so long
Since you went away
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day
Crow Jane Crow Jane
Horrors in her head
That her tongue dare not name
She lives alone by the river
The rolling rivers of pain
Crow Jane Crow Jane
Crow Jane Ah hah huh
There is one shining eye on a hardhat
The company closed down the mine
Winking on waters they came
Twenty hardhats, twenty eyes
In her clapboard shack
Only six foot by five
They killed all her whiskey
And poured their pistols dry
Crow Jane Crow Jane
Crow Jane Ah hah huh
Seems you've remembered
How to sleep, how to sleep
The house dogs are in your turnips
And your yard dogs are running all over the street
Crow Jane Crow Jane
Crow Jane Ah hah huh
"O Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson
Why you close up shop so late?"
"Just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird
Measured .32, .44, .38
I asked that girl which road she was taking
Said she was walking the road of hate
But she stopped on a coaltrolley up to New Haven
Crow Jane Crow Jane
Crow Jane Ah hah huh
Your guns are drunk and smoking
They've followed you right back to your gate
Laughing all the way back from the new town
Population, now, 28
Crow Jane Crow Jane
Crow Jane Ah hah huh
Now that mountains of meaningless words
and oceans divide us
And we each have our own set of stars
to comfort and guide us
Come into my sleep
Come into my sleep, oh yeah
Dry your eyes and do not weep
Come into my sleep
Swim to me through the deep blue sea
upon the scattered stars set sail
Fly to me through this lovelit night
from one thousand miles away
And come into my sleep
Come into my sleep oh yeah
As midnight nears and shadows creep
Come into my sleep
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair
For I am sick at heart, my dear
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair
For all the sorrow it will pass, my dear
Take your accusation, your recriminations
and toss them into the ocean blue
Leave your regrets and impossible longings
and scatter them across the sky behind you
And come into my sleep
Come into my sleep
For my soul to comfort and keep
Come into my sleep
For my soul to comfort and keep  my sleep
You better run You better run and run and run
You better run You better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run You better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You stand before your maker
In a state of shame
Bacause your robes are covered in mud
While your kneel at the feet
Of a woman of the street
The gutters will run with blood
They will run with blood!
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
In the days of madness
My brother, my sister
When you're dragged toward the Hellmouth
You will beg at the end
But there ain't gonna be one, friend
For the grave will spew you out
It will spew you out!
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You'll be working in the darkness
Against your fellow man
And you'll find you're called to come forth
So you'll scrub and you'll scrub
But the trouble is, bud
The blood it won't wash off
No, it won't come off!
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run and run and run
You better run to the City of Refuge
Christina the Astonishing
Lived a long time ago
SHe was stricken with a seizure
At the age of twentytwo
They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei
She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried "The stink of human sin
Is more that I can bear"
Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball
She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl
O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meusse and swim away
O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in terrifying manner
Died at the age of seventyfour
In the convent of St Anna
We've come to bring you home
Haven't we, Cassiel?
To cast aside your loss and all of your sadness
And shuffle off that mortal coil and mortal madness
For we're here to pick you up and bring you home
Aren't we, Cassiel?
It's a place where you did not belong
Where time itself was mad and far too strong
Where life leapt up laughing and hit you hear on and hurt you
Didn't it hurt you, Cassiel?
While time outran you and trouble flew toward you
And you were there to greet it
Weren't you, foolish Cassiel?
But here we are, we've come to call you home
And here you'll stay, never more to stray
Where you can kick off your boots of clay
Can't you, Cassiel?
For death and you did recklessly collide
And time ran out of you, and you ran out of time
Didn't you, Cassiel?
And all the clocks in all the world
May this once just skip a beat in memory of you
But then again those damn clocks, they probably won't
Will they, Cassiel?
One moment you are there
Then strangely you are gone
But on behalf of us all here
We're glad to have you home
Aren't we, dear Cassiel?
I lay down by the river
The shadows moved across me, inch by inch
And all that I heard
Was the war between the water and the bridge
Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me
Turn and drink of me
Or look away, look away, look away
And never more think of me
I heard the many voices
Speaking to me from the depths below
This ancient wound
Beneath the whited snow
Come to me, come to me, come to me
Come and drink of me
Or turn away, turn away, turn away
And never more think of me
Carry me away
Who will lay down their hammer?
Who will put up their sword?
And pause to see
Of the Word
Carry me away
Carry me away
You have a heart and I have a key
Lie back and let me unlock you
Those heathens you hang with down by the sea
All they want to do is defrock you
I know a river, where we can dream
It will swell up, burst it's banks,
babe, and rock you
But if you're gonna dine with them cannibals
Sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten
But I'm glad you've come around
here with your animals
And your heart that is bruised but unbeaten
And beating like a drum
I will sit like a bird on a fence
Sing you songs with a happy ending
Swoop down and tell you that it don't make sense
To attack the very thing you're defending
Didn't I just buy that dress for you?
That pink paper pinafore that you keep mending
Well, if you're gonna dine with the cannibals
Sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten
But I'm glad you've come around
here with your animals
And your heart that is banging and beating
And banging like a gong
I can see that they've hurt you, dear
Here is some moonlight to cloak us
And I will never desert you here
Unpetaled among the crocus
Allow me, my love, to allay your fear
As I swim, in and out of focus
But if you're gonna dine with the cannibals
Sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten
But I'm glad you've come around
here with your animals
And your heart that is bruised but bleating
And bleeding like a lamb
Banging like a gong
Beating like a drum
The Captain's forearm like bunchtup rope
with ANITA wrigglin free onto skull'n'dagger
and a portrait of Christ, nailed to an anchor
etched into the upper...
Slams his fucken tindish down
Our Captain, takes time to crush
Some BlooBottles glowin in his gruel
with a lump in his throat, and lumpy mush
Thumbing a scrap book stuck up with clag
and a morbid lump of Love in his flag.
Done is the Missing, now all that remain
Is to sail forever, upon the stain
Cabin Fever! O o o' Cabin Fever!
The captain's freehand is a clearer
which he fashions his beard'n'he rations his jerkey!
and carves his peg onto the finest mahagony!
Or was it Ebony? etc...
Tallys up his loneliness, notch by notch
For the sea offers nuthin to hold or touch
Notch by notch, winter by winter
Notch x notch, winter x winter
Now his leg is whittled, right down to a splinter
O o Cabin Fever! O o o Cabin Fever!
O the rollin sea still rollin on!
She's everywhere! now that she's gone! Gone! Gone!
O Cabin Fever! O Cabin Fever!
Welcome to his table, BelovedUnconscious
Raisin her host of hair from her crooks
and strugglin to summony one of her looks!
His arm now like coild ssssnakes
Whips all the bottles that he's drunken,
like crystalskittles about the cabin,
of a ship they'd bin sailing
Five years sunken... etc...
By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising
And she'll find that note that I left hanging on the door
And she'll laugh when she reads the part
That says "I'm leaving"
Cause I've left that girl so many times before
And by the time I get to Albuquerque, she'll be working
And she'll take off time just to give me a call
And she'll hear that phone keep right on ringing and ringing
On the wall, yeah oh, that's all
And by the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly in her sleep and call my name out low
And then she'll cry just to think that I'd really leave her, I left her
But time after time after time I tried to tell her so
But she just didn't know That I would really go
That I would really go
Brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
I am the captain of my pain
Tis the bit, the bridle,
The trashing cane
The stirrup, the harness
The whipping mane
The pickled eye
The shrinking brain
O brother, buy me one more drink
I'll explain the nature of my pain
Yes, let me tell you once again
I am the captain of my pain
O brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
I cannot blame it all on her
To blame her all would be a lie
For many a night I lay awake
And wished that I could watch her die
To see her accusing finger spurt
To see flies swarm her hateful eye
To watch her groaning in the dirt
To see her clicking tongue crack dry
O brother, buy me one more drink
One more drink and then goodbye
And do not mock me when I say
Let's drink one more before I die
O brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
Well I've been sliding down on rainbows
Well I've been swinging from the stars
Now this wretch in beggars clothing
Bangs his cup across the bars
Look, this cup of mine is empty!
Seems I've misplaced my desires
Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes
Of all my former fires
So brother, be a brother
And fill this tiny cup of mine
And please, sir, make it whiskey
For I have no head for wine
O brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
I counted up my blessings
And counted only one
One tiny little blessing
And now that blessings gone
So buy me one more drink, my brother
Then I'm taking to the road
Yes, I'm taking to the rain
I'm taking to the snow
O my friend, my only brother
Do not let the party grieve
So throw a dollar onto the bar
Now kiss my ass and leave
O brother, my cup is empty
And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
Up those stone steps I climb
Hail this joyful day's return
Into its great shadowed vault I go
Hail the Pentecostal morn
The reading is from Luke 24
Where Christ returns to his loved ones
I look at the stone apostles
Think that it's alright for some
And I wish that I was made of stone
So that I would not have to see
A beauty impossible to define
A beauty impossible to believe
A beauty impossible to endure
The blood imparted in little sips
The smell of you still on my hands
As I bring the cup up to my lips
No God up in the sky
No devil beneath the sea
Could do the job that you did, baby
Of bringing me to my knees
Outside I sit on the stone steps
With nothing much to do
Forlorn and exhausted, baby
By the absence of you
This garden that I built for you
That you sit in now and yearn
I will never leave it, dear
I could not bear to return
And find it all untended
With the trees all bended low
This garden is our home, dear
And I got nowhere else to go
So bring it on
Bring it on
Every little tear
Bring it on
Every useless fear
Bring it on
All your shattered dreams
And I'll scatter them into the sea
Into the sea
The geraniums on your window sill
The carnations, dear, and the daffodil
Well, they're ordinary flowers
But they long for the light of your touch
And of your trembling will
Ah, you're trembling still
And I am trembling too
To be perfectly honest I don't know
Quite what else to do
So bring it on
Bring it on
Every neglected dream
Bring it on
Every little scheme
Bring it on
Every little fear
And I'll make them disappear
So bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on
Every little thing
Bring it on
Every tiny fear
Bring it on
Every shattered dream
And I'll scatter them into the sea
It's up in the morning and on the downs
Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
And I am breathless over you
And the redbreasted robin beats his wings
His throat it trembles when he sings
For he is helpless before you
The happy hooded bluebells bow
And bend their heads all adown
Heavied by the early morning dew
At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
The fishes leap up to take a look
For they are breathless over you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your mind
Still your soul
For still, the fare of love is true
And I am breathless without you
The wind circles among the trees
And it bangs about the newmade leaves
For it is breathless without you
The fox chases the rabbit round
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
For he is defenceless without you
The sky of daytime dies away
And all the earthly things they stop to play
For we are all breathless without you
I listen to my juddering bones
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
And I am breathless without you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your soul
Still your mind
Still, the fire of love is true
And I am breathless without you
I got a blue bird
A blue bird on my shoulder
I got a blue bird
A blue bird on my shoulder
I saw her standing
Standing by the water
She was naked
Her hair in great disorder
And I know why I'm flying
And the rest is lies
I sent a warning
A warning of disaster
I sent a warning
I warned of great disaster
I sent that blue bird
That blue bird down the water
I sent that blue bird
Floating down the water
And I know that I'm flying
And the rest is lies
And I know that I'm flying
And the rest is lies.
Bline Lemon Jefferson is acoming.
Tap tap tappin with his cane.
Bline Lemon Jefferson is acoming.
Tap tap tappin with his cane.
His last ditch lies down the road of trials
Half filled with rain.
O Sycamore, Sycamore!
Stretch your arms across the storm.
Down fly two greasy brothercrows
They hop'n'bop hop'n'bop hop'n'bop
Like the taxman come to call.
They go knock knock! Knock knock!
They slap a deathwrit on his door.
Here come the Judgement train
Git on board!
And turn that big black engine home.
O let's roll!
Down the tunnel.
The terrible tunnel of his world.
Waiting at his final station
Like a bigger blacker third bird.
O let's roll!
O his road is dark and lonely.
He don't drive no Cadillac.
O his road is dark and holy.
He don't drive no cadillac.
If that sky serves as his eyes
Then that moons a cataract.
Yeah let's roll!
Last night my kisses were banked in black hair
And in my bed, my lover, her hair was midnight black
And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair
And her black hair framed a happy heartshaped face
And heavyhooded eyes inside her black hair
Shined at me frome the depths of her hair of deepest black
While my fingers pushed into her straight black hair
Pulling her black hair back from her happy heartshaped face
To kiss her milkwhite throat, a dark curtain of black hair
Smothered me, my lover with her beautiful black hair
The smell of it is heavy. It is charged with life
On my fingers the smell of her deep black hair
Full of all my whispered words, her black hair
And wet with tears and goodbyes, her hair of deepest black
All my tears cried against her milkwhite throat
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair
As deep as ink and black, black as the deepest sea
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow
Where her head and all its black hair did rest
Today she took a train to the West
Today she took a train to the West
Today she took a train to the West
Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm
I am the black crow king
Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm
I am the black crow king
Keeper of the nodding corn
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
All the hammers are atalking
All the nails are asinging
So sweet and low.
You can hear it in the valley
Where live the lame and the blind
They climb the hill out of its belly
They leave with mean black boots on.
"I just made a simple gesture
They jumped up and nailed it to my shadow
My gesture was a hooker
You know, my shadow's made of timber."
And the storm is arolling
And the storm is arolling
All down on me.
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone
Ah'm still here rolling and I'm left on my own
The blackbirds have all flown!
Everyone's rolled on!
I am the black crow king
Keeper of the trodden corn
I am the black crow king
Won't say it again
And the rain it raineth daily.
And wash away my clothes
I surrender up my arms
To a company of crows
I am the black crow king
I won't say it again
And all the thorns are acrowning
King ruby on each spine
And the spears are asailing
O my o my.
And the storm is arolling
And the storm is arolling
All down on me.
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone
I'm still here rolling and left on my own
Those blackbirds they have all flown and
I am on my own.
I am the black crow king
Keeper of the forgotten corn
The King! The King!
I'm the king of nuthin' at all
The hammers are atalking
The nails are asinging
The thorns are acrowning him
The spears are asailing
The crows are amocking
The corn is anodding
The storm is arolling
The storm is arolling
The storm is arolling down
The storm is arolling down
The storm is arolling
Down on me
Rolling down on me
Rolling down on me.
Well the sun done gone
The way I do now
Way above her knees
Above her knees
Well the sun done gone
That Monday, I was arrested
Tuesday, I locked up in jail
Wednesday baby, my trial's tested
On Thursday, nobody could blow my bail
And I ain't gonna yell against no bells
On Monday, baby I went awalking
Tuesday, I .... asked to go
On Wednesday I sat down atalking
On Thursday she hock all a my clothes
And I ain't gonna .... no more
Stay by me, stay by me
You are the one, my only true love
The butcher bird makes it's noise
And asks you to agree
With it's brutal nesting habits
And it's pointless savagery
Now, the nightingale sings to you
And raises up the ante
I put one hand on your round ripe heart
And the other down your panties
Everything is falling, dear
Everything is wrong
It's just history repeating itself
And babe, you turn me on
Like a light bulb
Like a song
You race naked through the wilderness
You torment the birds and the bees
You leapt into the abyss, but find
It only goes up to your knees
I move stealthily from tree to tree
I shadow you for hours
I make like I'm a little deer
Grazing on the flowers
Everything is collapsing, dear
All moral sense has gone
It's just history repeating itself
And babe, you turn me on
Like an idea
Like an Atom bomb
We stand awed inside a clearing
We do not make a sound
The crimson snow falls all about
Carpeting the ground
Everything is falling, dear
All rhyme and reason gone
It's just history repeating itself
And, babe, you turn me on
Like an idea
Like an Atom bomb
Babe I got you bad
Dreaming bloodwet dreams
only madmen have
Baby I got you bad
I wish to God I never had
And it makes me feel so sad,
O, Baby I got you bad
Yeah, Babe I got you bad
I long for your kiss,
for the turn of your mouth
Your body is a long thing
And I don't know what I'm talking about
All of my words have gone mad
Ah, baby I got you bad
Seasons have gone wrong
And I lay me down in a bed of snow
Darling, since you've been gone
well my hands, they don't know where to go
And all of my teeth are bared,
I got you so much I'm scared
Ah, baby I got you bad
With the sweep of my hand
I undid all the plans
that explode at the moment I kissed you
on your small hot mouth
and your caramel limbs
that are hymns to the glory that is you.
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad
Baby I got you bad
Smoke bilowing from the bridges
and the rivers we swim in are boiling
My hands are reaching for you everywhere
but you're not there, or you're recoiling
and a weary moon dangles from a cloud
Oh honey, I know it's not allowed
To say I got you bad.
I got you bad...
I got you bad...
I got you bad...

I stepped into an avalanche
It covered up my soul
When I am not this hunchback that you see
I sleep beneath the golden hill
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn to serve me well
You strike my side by accident
As you go down to your goal
This cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold
He does not ask for your company
Not at the centre, the centre of the world
I who am on a pedestal
You did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me now
To kneel grotesque and bare
For I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn what makes me kind
The crumbs of love that you offer me
Are the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just a shadow of my wound
I have begun to ask for you
I who have no greed
I have begun to long for you
I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe
Do not dress in those rags for me
I know you are not poor
And do not love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure
It is your turn, my beloved one
It is your flesh that I wear
As I sat sadly by her side
At the window through the glass
She stroked a kitten in her lap
And we watched the world as it fell past
Softly she spoke these words to me
And with brand new eyes, open wide
We pressed our faces to the glass
As I sat sadly by her side.
She said, 'Father, mother, sister, brother,
Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece,
Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer,
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest,
Earth and moon and sun and stars
Planets and comets with tails blazing
All are there forever falling
Falling lovely and amazing.'
Then she smiled and turned to me
And waited for me to reply
Her hair was falling down her shoulders
As I sat sadly by her side.
As I sat sadly by her side
The kitten she did gently pass
Over to me and again we pressed
Our different faces to the glass
'That may be very well,' I said
'But watch that one falling in the street
See him gesture to his neighbours
See him trampled beneath their feet
All outward motion connects to nothing
For each is concerned with their immediate need
Witness the man reaching up from the gutter
See the other stumbling on who does not see.'
With trembling hand I turned toward her
And pushed the hair out of her eyes
The kitten jumped back to her lap
As I sat sadly by her side.
Then she drew the curtains down
And said, 'When will you ever learn
That what happens there beyond the glass
Is simply none of your concern?
God has given you but one heart
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers
And God does not care for your benevolence
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others
Nor does he care for those who sit
At windows in judgement of the world He created
While sorrows pile up around him
Ugly, useless and overinflated.'
At which she turned her head away
Great tears leaping from her eyes
I could not wipe the smile from my face
As I sat sadly by her side.
And no more shall we part
It will no longer be necessary
And no more will I say, dear heart
I am alone and she has left me
And no more shall we part
The contracts are drawn up, the ring is locked upon the finger
And never again will my letters start
Sadly, or in the depths of winter
And no more shall we part
All the hatchets have been buried now
And all of birds will sing to your
Upon the bough
And no more shall we part
Your chain of command has been silenced now
And all of those birds would've sung to your beautiful heart
Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I will never be free
If I'm not free now
Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I never was free
What are you talking about?
For no more shall we part
And no more shall we part
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
A handmedown dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's gown
And cry behind the door
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Why silks and plumes of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what shall she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning
A blackened shroud, a handmedown gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties
Albert goes west, he crossed the vast indifferent deserts of Arizona, oh yeah
He had a psychotic episode on a dude ranch that involved a bottle of ammonia
Henry, he went south and lost his way deep in the weeping forests of Le Vulva
He grew so wan, he grew so sick, he ended up in a bungalow sucking a revolver
The light upon your rainy streets offers many reflections
I won't be hold responsible for my actions
Bobby, he goes north, then goes east, then over to New Hampshire
Bobby is a cautious man, he walked into a Concord dive to drink a beer
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna move?
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna groove?
I said the world is full of endless abstractions
And I won't be held responsible for my actions
Me, I ain't going anywhere, just sit and watch the sun come up, I like it here
I watch the people go ticking past, go hey hey hey, you know I gotta say I like it here
Sha lalala, sha lalala, sha lalalalalala
Shalalala, sha lalala, sha lalalalalala
Once there came a storm in the form of a girl
It blew to pieces my snug little world
Sometimes I swear I can still hear her howl
Down through the wreckage and the ruins
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
Now the storm has passed over me
I'm left to drift on a dead calm sea
And watch her forever through the cracks in the beams
Nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
Now I got no one to hold
Now I am all alone again
It ain't too hot but it ain't too cold
And there is no sign of rain
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
Here I'm on my own
She ain't coming back no more
She ain't coming back no more
She ain't coming back no more
Say what you will, I don't care
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone, yeah
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby has gone
The sun is high up in the sky and I'm in my car
Drifting down into the abattoir
Do you see what I see, dear?
The air grows heavy. I listen to your breath
Entwined together in this culture of death
Do you see what I see, dear?
Slide on over here, let me give you a squeeze
To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory
Can you hear what I hear, babe?
Does it make you feel afraid?
Everything's dissolving, babe, according to plan
The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land
I went to bed last night and my
moral code got jammed
I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand
I kissed you once. I kissed you again
My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange
Do you feel what I feel, dear?
Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy
These things are not good for me
Do you see what I see, dear?
The line the God throws down to you and me
Makes a pleasing geometry
Shall we leave this place now, dear?
Is there someway out of here?
I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work
The need for validation, babe, gone completely
I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out such a
I got the abattoir blues
I got the abattoir blues
I got the abattoir blues
Right down to my shoes
Who'll build a box for Black Paul?
Ah'm enquirin on behalf of his soul
Ah'd be beholdin to ya all
For a lil information, yes some kinda information
Just who'll dig the hole?
When ya done ransackin his room
grabbin anything that shines,
throw the scrap down on the street
Like all his books and his notes.
All the junk that he wrote
the whole fucken lot right up in smoke
Aint there nuthin sacred anymore
Someone will build a box for Black Paul?
And there shootin off his guns
and there shootin off their mouths
saying 'Fuck with us ... and die!'
Let's see that rat of fear go scuttle in their skulls
'Cover that eye! Cover that frozen eye!'
Blackpuppet, in a heap up against the stoningwall
Bludpuppet, go to sleep, mama won't scold ya anymore
Armies of ants, wade up the lil red streams
they're headin for the motherpool
O lord, it's cruel, O man it's hot!
And some of them ants they yes ilot to the spot
Who threw the first stone at Black Paul?
'Don't ack us', say the critics and the hacks
The penpushers and the quacks
'We jes cum to git dah facks!'
'We jes cum to git dah facks!'
Here is the hammer, that build the scaffold,
and built the box...
Here is the shovel, that dug the hole,
in this ground of rocks...
And here is the pile of stones!
and for each one planted, God only knows,
a bludrose grown...
These are the true DemonFlowers!
These are the true DemonFlowers!
Stand back everyone! Bludblack everyone!
Who'll build a box for Black Paul?
Who'll carry it up the hill?
'Not I', said the widow, adjusting his veil
'Ah will not drive the nail
Or cart his puppetbody home,
For ah done that one hundred times before,
Yeah! ah done that one hundred times or more,
And why should ah dress his wounds?
When he has wounded my dress, nighty,
Right across the floor'
Who'll build a box for Black Paul?
Who'll carry it up the hill?
Who'll bury it in the blacksoil?
And from the words and the thickets
Come the ghosts of his victims
'We love you!'
'Ah love you!'
'and this will not hurt a bit,
we'll go up,up,up,up,up into Death
up,up,up,up, inhale its breath
O yeah, Death favours those that favor Death'
Here is the stone, and this is the inscription at bare
'Below Lies Black Paul, Under The Upper...
But Above and Beyond The SurfaceFlatFall There.'
And all the angels come on down,
And all you men and women crowd around
And all the widows weeping into their skirts
And all the lil gals and the lil Boys
And the scribes with meinpens parsed
All the hullaballoo, all the norse
All the hullaballoo, all the noise
All the hullaballoo, all of the noise
clears his throat of black blut
singin Black Paul like a lonely boy...
Weeell, ah have cryed one thousand tears
Ah've cryed a thousand tears, its true
And the next stormy night ya know,
That ah'm still cryin them for you
Well, ah had a gal she was so sweet,
Red dress, and long red hair hangin down
And heaven yes ain't heaven
Without that lil gal hangin around
Well, ya know ah've loin a badman
and Lord knows ah dun some good things too
But ah confess, my soul will never rest
Until you, until you build
Until ya build a box for my gal, too.
I've felt you coming girl, as you drew near
I knew you'd find me, cause I longed you here
Are you my desitiny? Is this how you'll appear?
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
As you've been moving surely toward me
My soul has comforted and assured me
That in time my heart it will reward me
And that all will be revealed
So I've sat and I've watched an iceage thaw
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built
Out of longing great wonders have been willed
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill
And lay your head upon my shoulder
Outside my window the world has gone to war
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
O we will know, won't we?
The stars will explode in the sky
O but they don't, do they?
Stars have their moment and then they die
There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him
He said, "He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in"
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting
And how every little thing anticipates you
All down my veins my heartstrings call
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
It's up in the morning and on the downs
Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
And I am breathless over you
And the redbreasted robin beats his wings
His throat it trembles when he sings
For he is helpless before you
The happy hooded bluebells bow
And bend their heads all adown
Heavied by the early morning dew
At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
The fishes leap up to take a look
For they are breathless over you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your mind
Still your soul
For still, the fare of love is true
And I am breathless without you
The wind circles among the trees
And it bangs about the newmade leaves
For it is breathless without you
The fox chases the rabbit round
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
For he is defenceless without you
The sky of daytime dies away
And all the earthly things they stop to play
For we are all breathless without you
I listen to my juddering bones
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
And I am breathless without you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your soul
Still your mind
Still, the fire of love is true
And I am breathless without you
I am tall and I am thin
Of an enviable hight
And I've been known to be quite handsome
In a certain angle and in certain light
Well I entered into O'Malley's
Said, "O'Malley I have a thirst"
O'Malley merely smiled at me
Said "You wouldn't be the first"
I knocked on the bar and pointed
To a bottle on the shelf
And as O'Malley poured me out a drink
I sniffed and crossed myself
My hand decided that the time was nigh
And for a moment it slipped from view
And when it returned, it fairly burned
With confidence anew
Well the thunder from my steely fist
Made all the glasses jangle
When I shot him, I was so handsome
It was the light, it was the angle
"Neighbours!" I cried, "Friends!" I screamed
I banged my fist upon the bar
"I bear no grudge against you!"
And my dick felt long and hard
"I am the man for which no God waits
But for which the whole world yearns
I'm marked by darkness and by blood
And one thousand powderburns"
Well, you know those fish with the swollen lips
That clean the ocean floor
When I looked at poor O'Malley's wife
That's exactly what I saw
I jammed the barrel under her chin
And her face looked raw and vicious
Her head it landed in the sink
With all the dirty dishes
Her little daughter Siobhan
Pulled beers from dusk till down
And amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke
But she pulled the best beer in town
I swooped magnificent upon her
As she sat shivering in her grief
Like the Madonna painted on the churchhouse wall
In whale's blood and banana leaf
Her throat it crumbled in my fist
And I spun heroically around
To see Caffrey rising from his seat
I shot that mother fucker down
Mmmmmmmmmm Yeah Yeah Yeah
"I have no free will", I sang
As I flew about the murder
Mrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed
You really should have heard her
I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept
I panted like a pup
I blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes
And her husband stupidly stood up
As he screamed, "You are an evil man"
And I paused a while to wonder
"If I have no free will then how can I
Be morally culpable, I wonder"
I shot Richard Holmes in the stomach
And gingerly he sat down
And he whispered weirdly, "No offense"
And then lay upon the ground
"None taken", I replied to him
To which he gave a little cough
With blazing wings I neatly aimed
And blew his head completely off
I've lived in this town for thirty years
And to noone I am a stranger
And I put new bullets in my gun
Chamber upon chamber
And I turned my gun on the birdlike Mr. Brookes
I thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows
And as I shot down the youthful Richardson
It was St. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows
I said, "I want to introduce myself
And I am glad that all you came"
And I leapt upon the bar
And shouted out my name
Well Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool
Closed his eyes and shrugged and laughed
And with an ashtray as big as a fucking really big brick
I split his head in half
His blood spilled across the bar
Like a steaming scarlet brook
And I knelt at it's edge on the counter
Wiped the tears away and looked
Well, the light in there was blinding
Full of God and ghosts of truth
I smiled at Henry Davenport
Who made an attempt to move
Well, from the position I was standing
The strangest thing I ever saw
The bullet entered through the top of his chest
And blew his bowels out on the floor
Well I floated down the counter
Showing no remorse
I shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter
But remorse i felt and remorse I had
It clung to every thing
From the raven's hair upon my head
To the feathers on my wings
Remorse sqeezed my hand in it's fradulent claw
With it's golden hairless chest
And I glided through the bodies
And killed the fat man Vincent West
Who sat quietly in his chair
A man become a child
And I raised the gun up to his head
He made no attempt to resist
So fat and dull and lazy
"Did you know I lived in your street?" I said
And he looked at me as though I were crazy
"O", he said, "I had no idea"
And he grew as quiet as a mouse
And the roar of the pistol when it went off
Near blew that hat right off the house
Hmmmmmm Uh Uh
Well, I caught my eye in the mirror
And gave it a long and loving inspection
"There stands some kind of man", I roared
And there did, in the reflection
My hair combed back like a raven's wing
My muscles hard and tight
And curling from the business end of my gun
Was a querymark of cordite
Well I spun to the left, I spun to the right
And I spun to the left again
"Fear me! Fear me! Fear me!"
But no one did cause they were dead
And then there were the police sirens wailing
And a bullhorn squelched and blared
"Drop your weapons and come out
With your hands held in the air"
Well, I checked the chamber of my gun
Saw I had one final bullet left
My hand, it looked almost human
As I raised it to my head
"Drop your weapon and come out!
Keep your hands above your head!"
I had one one long hard think about dying
And did exactly what they said
There must have been fifty cops out there
In a circle around O'Malley's bar
"Don't shoot", I cried, "I'm a man unarmed!"
So they put me in their car

As I sat sadly by her side
At the window through the glass
She stroked a kitten in her lap
And we watched the world as it fell past
Softly she spoke these words to me
And with brand new eyes, open wide
We pressed our faces to the glass
As I sat sadly by her side.
She said, 'Father, mother, sister, brother,
Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece,
Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer,
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest,
Earth and moon and sun and stars
Planets and comets with tails blazing
All are there forever falling
Falling lovely and amazing.'
Then she smiled and turned to me
And waited for me to reply
Her hair was falling down her shoulders
As I sat sadly by her side.
As I sat sadly by her side
The kitten she did gently pass
Over to me and again we pressed
Our different faces to the glass
'That may be very well,' I said
'But watch that one falling in the street
See him gesture to his neighbours
See him trampled beneath their feet
All outward motion connects to nothing
For each is concerned with their immediate need
Witness the man reaching up from the gutter
See the other stumbling on who does not see.'
With trembling hand I turned toward her
And pushed the hair out of her eyes
The kitten jumped back to her lap
As I sat sadly by her side.
Then she drew the curtains down
And said, 'When will you ever learn
That what happens there beyond the glass
Is simply none of your concern?
God has given you but one heart
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers
And God does not care for your benevolence
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others
Nor does he care for those who sit
At windows in judgement of the world He created
While sorrows pile up around him
Ugly, useless and overinflated.'
At which she turned her head away
Great tears leaping from her eyes
I could not wipe the smile from my face
As I sat sadly by her side.
just like an animal
just like an animal
just like an animal
you let me violate you
you let me desecrate you
you let me penetrate you
you let me complicate you
i broke apart my insides
i've got no soul to sell
the only thing that works for me
help me get away
i wanna fuck you
i wanna taste you
i wanna feel you
i wanna be you
just like an animal
just like an animal
just like an animal
just like an animal
you can have my isolation
you can have the hate that it brings
you can have my absence of faith
you can have my everything
you tear down my all reason
you see through what i hide
you make me perfect
help me get inside
i wanna fuck you
i wanna taste you
i wanna feel you
i wanna be you
i wanna fuck you
i wanna taste you
i wanna feel you
i wanna be you
this is the first day of my last days
i built it up now i take it apart climbed up real high now fall down real far
no need for me to stay the last thing left i just threw it away
i put my faith in god and my trust in you
now there's nothing more fucked up i could do
wish there was something real wish there was something true
wish there was something real in this world full of you
i'm the one without a soul i'm the one with this big fucking hole
no new tale to tell twentysix years on my way to hell
gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck
don't think you're having all the fun
you know me i hate everyone
wish there was something real wish there was something true
wish there was something real in this world full of you
i want to but i can't turn back
but i want to
did you happen to catch
or did it happen so fast
what you thought would always last
has passed you by
is everything speeding up
or am I slowing down
just spinning around
and I don't know why
all the pieces don't fit
thought I didn't give a shit
I never wanted to be like you
but for all I aspire
I am really a liar
and I'm running out of things I can do
I'd like to stay
but every day
everything pushes me further away
if you could show
help me to know
how it's supposed to be
where did it go?
where is everybody?
trying and lying
crying and dying
where is everybody?
well okay, enough,
you've had your fun
but come on thare has to be someone
that hasn't yet become
so numb and succumb
and god damn I am so tired of pretending
of wishing I was ending
when all I'm really doing is trying to hide
and keep it inside
and fill it with lies
open my eyes?
maybe I wish I could try
pleading and needing
and bleeding and breeding
and feeding exceeding
where is everybody?
trying and lying
crying and dying
where is everybody?
I've become impossible
holding on to when
when everything seemed to matter more
the two of us
all used and beaten up
watching fate as it flow down the path we
you and me
we're in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
if the world should break in two
until the very end of me
until the very end of you
awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin
they pick and they pull
trying to get their fingers in
well they've got to kill what we've found
well they've got to hate what we fear
well they've got to make it go away
well they've got to make it disappear
the farther I fall I'm beside you
as lost as I get I will find you
the deeper the wound I'm inside you
for ever and ever I'm a part of
you and me
we're in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
if the world should break in two
until the very end of me
until the very end of you
all that we were is gone we have to hold on
all that we were is gone we have to hold on
when all our hope is gone we have to hold on
all that we were is gone but we can hold on
you and me
we're in this together now
none of them can stop us now
we will make it through somehow
you and me
even after everything
you're the queen and I'm the king
nothing else means anything
I let you put it in my mouth
I let it get under my skin
I let you pump it in my veins
I let you take me from within
They tell us what we can and cannot do
Thinking is what I have this head for
Well, I put you inside of me
But none of that matters anymore
Oh my god, can it go any faster
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here
I am you and you are me
We will never be alone
I have finally found my place in everything
I have finally found my home
We can leave all the past behind
I can see right through the whole facade
I'm becoming something else
I am turning into God
Oh my god, can it go any faster
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here
all I do
I can still feel you
numb all through
I can still feel you
hear your call
underneath it all
kill my brain
yet you still remain
after all I've died
after all I've tried
you are still inside
all I do
I can still feel you
I am stained
just a reflection
just a glimpse
just a little reminder
of all the what abouts
and all the might have
could have beens
some other way
but not another reason to continue
and now you're one of us
the hopes and prays
the better days
the far aways
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?
now you know
this is what it feels like
now you know
this is what it feels like
the clouds will part and the sky cracks open
and god himself will reach his fucking arm through
just to push you down
just to hold you down
stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
and it's hard to believe it could come down to thisback at the beginning
and in the end
we still pretend
the time we spend
not knowing when
you're finally free
and you could be
but it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
it didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it
now you know
this is what it feels like
now you know
this is what it feels like
you can try to stop it but it keeps on coming
you can try to stop it but
all I've undergone
I will keep on
underneath it all
we feel so small
the heavens fall
but still we crawl
all I've undergone
I will keep on
Some say it was a warning
Some say it was a sign
I was standing right there
When it came down from the sky
They were expecting us
We felt it from inside
Said it was up to us
Up to us to decide
You've become a virus
That's eaten up its host
We've been watching you with all our eyes
And what you seem to value most
'I don't want your attention,' or so you used to say
Your greed, selfimportance and your elegance
You piss it all way
May be a crime
We've come to intervene
You either change the way you've been doing things
Or we will wipe this place clean
Your time is ticktickticking away
I got my head but my head is unraveling
cant keep control can't keep track of where it's traveling
I got my heart but my heart's no good
you're the only one that's understood
I come along but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go but you're wrenching dragging shaking me
turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky
the more I give to you the more I die
and I want you
you are the perfect drug
the perfect drug
the perfect drug
the perfect drug
you make me hard when i'm all soft inside
I see the truth when i'm all stupideyed
the arrow goes straight through my heart
without you everything just falls apart
my blood just wants to say hello to you
my fear is warm to get inside of you
my soul is so afraid to realize
how every little bit is left of me
take me with you
without you everything just falls apart
it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
and right now i'm so in love with you.
and i don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do.
lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars.
while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.
nothing quite like the feel of something new.
maybe i'm all messed up.
maybe i'm all messed up.
maybe i'm all messed up in you.
maybe i'm all messed up.
maybe i'm all messed up.
maybe i'm all messed up.
maybe i'm all messed up in you.
maybe i'm all messed up.
this is the only time i really feel alive.
this is the only time i really feel alive.
i just found everything i need.
the sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me.
well i want to wrap it up and swim in it until i drown.
my moral standing is lying down.
you're keeping in step
and in the line
got your chin held high and you feel just fine
because you do
what you're told
but inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold
just how deep do you believe?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
will you chew until it bleeds?
can you get up off your knees?
are you brave enough to see?
do you want to change it?
what if this whole crusade's
and behind it all there's a price to be paid
for the blood
on which we dine
justified in the name of the holy and the divine
just how deep do you believe?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
will you chew until it bleeds?
can you get up off your knees?
are you brave enough to see?
do you want to change it?
to keep holding on to what I want to believe
i can see
but i keep holding on and on and on and on
will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
Say your name
Try to speak as clearly as you can
You know everything gets written down
Nod you head
Just in case they could be watching
With their shiny satellite
I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Building inside of me
To mirror everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer
Turn it up, listen to the shit they pump into your head
Filling it with apathy
Hold your breath, wait until you know the time is right
The end is near
I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Building inside of me
To mirror everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer
staring at the sea
will she come?
is there hope for me
after all is said and done
anything at any price
all of this for you
all the spoils of a wasted life
all of this for you
all the world has closed her eyes
tried faith all worn and thin
for all we could have done
and all that could have been
ocean pulls me close
and whispers in my ear
the destiny I've chose
all becoming clear
the currents have their say
the time is drawing near
washes me away
makes me disappear
I descend from grace
in arms of undertow
I will take my place
in the geat below
I can still feel you
even so far away
Gunfire in the street
Where we used to meet
Echoes that are beat
When the bass goes 'bomb'
Right over my head
Step over the dead
Remember what you said
Y'know a part of my old life
Is just a waking dream
Well I know what you mean
But that ain't how it seems right here, right now
How can this be real?
I can barely feel
I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe
Blood hardens in the sand
Cold metal in my hand
Hope you understand the way that things are gonna be
There's nowhere left to hide
Cause god is on our side
I keep telling myself
I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe
in a world full of ugliness
she matters when everything is meaningless
she doesn't see her beauty
she tries to get away
it's just that nothing seems worth saving
I can't watch her slip away
I won't let you fall apart
she reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
hoping someone can see
if I could fix myseld I'd  but it's too late for me
I wont let you fall apart
we'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
I'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
...but they keep waiting
it's something I have to do
I was there, too
before everyhting else
I was like you
he couldn't believe how easy it was
he put the gun into his face
so much blood from such a tiny little hole
problems have solutions
a lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash
in this world
the deepest shade of mushroom blue
spilling out of my head
I'd listen to the world he'd say
but his voice I heard decay
the plastic face forced to portray
and the insides left cold and gray
there is a place that still remains
it eats the fear it eats the pain
the sweatest price he'll have to pay
the day the whole world went away
na na nah
na na na, nah
na na nah
na na na, nah
there is a game I play
try to make myself okay
try so hard to make the pieces all fit
smash it apart
just for the fuck of it
bye bye oooh
got to get back to the bottom
bye bye oooh
the big come down isn't that what you wanted?
bye bye oooh
find a place with the failed and forgotten
bye bye oooh
isn't that really what you wanted now?
there is no place I can go there is no way I can hide
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside
there is a hate that burns within
the most desperate place I have ever been
try to get back to where I'm from
the closer I get the worse it becomes
the closer I get the worse it becomes
there is no place I can go there is no place I can hide
it feels like it keeps coming from the inside
Down on your knees, you'll be left behind
This is the beginning
Watch what you think, they can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark, see it in my eyes
This is the beginning
Well, my reflection I don't recognise
This is the beginning
We think we've climbed so high
Above all the backs we've come down
We face no consequence
This is the beginning of the end
You wait your turn, you'll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way, 'cause I'm getting mine
This is the beginning
There are some ones that can help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late, as far as I can tell
This is the beginning
We think we've come so far
On all our lies been taken
They say no consequence
This is the beginning of the end
I beat my machine it's a part of me it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream it's changing me I am becoming
the me that you know had some second thoughts
he's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore
the me that you know doesn't come around much
that part of me isn't here anymore
all pain disappears it's the nature of my circuitry
drowns out all I hear there's no escape from this my new consciousness
that me that you know used to have feelings
but the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay
the me that you know is now made up of wires
and even when I'm right with you I'm so far away
I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all my bad parts
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear
hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter I might just slip away
it won't give up it wants me dead
goddamn this noise inside my head
just when everything was making sense.
you took away all my selfconfidence.
now all that i've been hearing must be true.
i guess i'm not the only boy for you.
but that's what i get
that's what i get
that's what i get
that's what i get
how could you turn us into this?
after you just taught me how to kiss you.
i told you i'd never say goodbye.
i'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.
but that's what i get.
that's what i get.
that's what i get.
that's what i get.
for trusting you.
that's what i get.
why does it come as a surprise.
to think that i was so naive.
maybe didn't mean too much.
but it meant everything to me.
why are you doing this to me?
am i not living up to what i'm supposed to be?
why am i seething with this animosity?
i think you owe me a great big apology.
i really don't know what you mean.
seems like salvation come only in our dreams.
i feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.
can this world really be as sad as it seems?
don't take it away from me.
i need someone to hold on to.
don't take it away from me.
i need someone to hold on to.
there's nothing left for me to hide.
i lost my ignorance, security and pride.
i'm all alone in a world you must despise.
i believed your promises, your promises and lies.
you made me throw it all away.
my morals left to decay.
how many you betray.
you've taken everything.
my head is filled with disease.
my skin is begging you please.
i'm on my hands and knees.
i want so much to believe.
i need someone to hold on to.
i need someone to hold on to.
i need someone i need someone.
i need someone to hold on to.
i give you everything.
my sweet everything.
i really don't know who i am.
in this world of piss
I should have listened to her
So hard to keep control
We kept on eating but
Our bloated belly's still not full
She gave us all she had but
We went and took some more
Can't seem to shut her legs
Our mother nature is a whore
I got my propaganda
I got revisionism
I got my violence
In hidef ultrarealism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist
I got my plan
I got survivalism
Hypnotic sound of sirens
Echoing through the street
The cocking of the rifles
The marching of the feet
You see your world on fire
Don't try to act surprised
We did just what you told us
Lost our faith along the way
And found ourselves believing your lies
I got my propaganda
I got revisionism
I got my violence
In hidef ultrarealism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist
I got my plan
I got survivalism
All bruised and broken, bleeding
She asked to take my hand
I turned, just keep on walking
But you'd do the same thing in the circumstance
I'm sure you'll understand
I got my propaganda
I got revisionism
I got my violence
In hidef ultrarealism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist
I got my plan
I got survivalism
There is no god up in the sky tonight
No sign of heaven anywhere in sight
All that was true is left behind
Once I could see now I am blind
Don't want your dreams you try to sell
This disease I give to myself
She makes it sweeter than the sun
I get too tight I come undone
I bow my head to confess
The temple walls are made of flesh
Runs up my arms 'til I'm on track
Itches my skin right off of my back
I'll heal your wounds
I'll set you free
I'm Jesus Christ on Ecstacy
A thousand lips a thousand tongues
A thousand throats a thousand lungs
A thousand ways to make it true
I want to do terrible things to you
my god sits in the back of the limousine
my god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
my god pouts on the cover of the magazine
my god's a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me
I play a game
it's called insincerity
I am every fucking thing and just a little more
I sold my soul but don't you dare call me a whore
and when I suck you off not a drop will go to waste
it's really not so bad you know once you get past the taste, yeah
all our pain
how did we ever get by without you?
you're so vain
I bet you think this song is about you
now I belong I'm one of the chosen ones
now I belong I'm one of the beautiful ones
so impressed with all you do
tried so hard to be like you
flew too high and burnt the wing
lost my faith in everything
lick around divine debris
taste the wealth of hate in me
shedding skin succumb defeat
this machine is obsolete
made the choice to go away
drink the fountain of decay
tear a hole exquisite red
fuck the rest and stab it dead
broken bruised forgotten sore
too fucked up to care anymore
poisoned to my rotten core
too fucked up to care anymore
in the back off the side far away is a place where I hide where I
stay tried to say tried to ask I needed to all alone by myself where were you?
how could I ever think it's funny how everything that
swore it wouldn't change is different now just like you
would always say we'll make it through then my head fell apart and where were you?
how could I ever think it's funny how everything you swore would
never change is different now like you said you and me make it
through didn't quite fell apart where the fuck were you?
I still recall the taste of your tears.
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore.
Come on tell me.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just one thing.
And I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go way.
You make this all go way.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have
You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now.
This thing is slowly taking me apart.
Grey would be the color if I had a heart.
Come on tell me
In this place it seems like such a shame.
Though it all looks different now,
I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see.
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have
Think I know what you meant.
That night on my bed.
Still picking at this scab
I wish you were dead.
You sweat and perry ellis.
Just stains on my sheets.
you give me the reason.
you give me control.
i gave you my Purity.
my Purity you stole.
did you think i wouldn't recognize this compromise.
am i just too stupid to realize.
stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies
it comes down to this.
and your strain.
it get's under my skin.
take in the extent of my sin
you give me the anger.
you give me the nerve.
carry out the sentence.
i get what i deserve.
i'm just an effigy to be defaced.
to be disgraced.
your need for me has been replaced.
and if i can't have everything well then just give me a taste.

It's still getting worse after everything I've tried.
What if I found a way to wash it all aside.
What if she touches with those fingertips,
As the words spill out like fire from her lips?
And if she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all I'll give everything to her.
I am justified. I am purified. I am sanctified. Inside you
Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel.
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed.
Well she knows exactly what I can't resist
I'm still caught up in another of her spells.
Well she's turning me into someone else.
Everyday I hope and pray this will end.
But when I can I do it all again
As surely as the blade's course is run.
Maybe my kingdom's finally come.
you had all of them on your side, didn't you?
you believe in all your lies, didn't you?
the ruiner's got a lot to prove
he's got nothing to lose and now he made you
the ruiner's your only friend well he's the living end to the cattle he
the raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease
how did you get so big?
how did you get so strong?
how did you get so hard?
how did you get so long?
you had to give them all a sign, didn't you?
you had to covet what was mine, didn't you?
the ruiner's a collector he's an infector serving his shit to his flies
maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly
maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go
and maybe that fucked me up so much more than you'll ever know
how did you get so big?
how did you get so strong?
how did you get so hard?
how did you get so long?
what you gave to me
my perfect ring of scars
you know I can see what you really are
you didn't hurt me nothing can hurt me
you didn't hurt me nothing can stop me now
well you've got me working so heard lately.
working my hands until they bleed.
if i was twice the man i could be.
i'd still be half of what you need
still you lead me and i follow
anything you ask you know i'll do.
but this one act of consecration is what i ask of you
promise carved in stone.
deeper than the sea.
sever flesh and bone
and offer it to me.
you just left me nailed here.
hanging like Jesus on the cross.
i'll be dying for your sins.
and aiding to the cause.
wrap my eyes in bandages.
confessions i see through.
i get everything i want.
when i get part of you.
promise carved in stone.
deeper than the sea.
devil's flesh and bone
do something for me.
she spread herself wide open to let the insects in
she leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
she has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
seeds from a thousand others drip down from within
oh my beautiful liar
oh my precious whore
my disease my infection
I am so impure
devils speak of the ways in which she'll manifest
angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
oh my beautiful liar
oh my precious whore
my disease my infection
I am so impure
I have a love that lives in me
He makes me sleep in perfect peace
He loves me strong and gently
He doesn't try to change me
No he'd never ever treat me bad
No he'd never call me names
He erases every memory of pain
You put your arms around me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been free
I love the life you've given me
We are each other's family
And I never ever treat you bad
And I never call you names
I will erase every memory of shame
You wrap yourself around me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been...I've been me
You put your arms around me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been free
You wrapped yourself around me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been me
well i think i'm gonna push it as far as it will go.
give in to desire.
only you will know.
so tell me all your secrets.
i'll stick it in your head.
i wish i could remember everything she said.
well she can be my savior with everything she does.
or some kind of punishment for people just like us.
i don't really believe she understands what's happening to me.
the sooner that she gets it the better it will be.
i have got it figured out. i should have known all along.
i can't live without her.
i have got it figured out.
this is how
push it away but it all comes back again
all the flesh
all the sin
there was a time when it used to mean just about everything
just like now
breathe, echoing the sound
time starts slowing down
sink until I drown
please I don't ever want to make it stop
and it keeps repeating
will you please complete me?
never be enough
to fill me up
watch the white
turn to red
it fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead
all my life
yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead
well guess what?
the world is over and I realize it was all in my head
now everything is clear
I erase the fear
I can disappear
please I don't ever want to make it stop
you can never leave me
will you pleaseb complete me
never be enough
to fill me up
hey pig piggy pig pig pig
all of my fears came true
black and blue and broken bones
you left me here I'm all alone
my little piggy needed something new
nothing can stop me now
I don't care anymore
nothing can stop me now
I just don't care
nothing's turning out the way I planned
hey pig there's a lot of things I hoped you could help me understand
what am I supposed to do I lost my shit because of you
nothing can stop me now
I don't care anymore
nothing can stop me now
I just don't care
nothing can stop me now
you don't need me anymore
I wanna take you baby
I wanna take you out
I wanna wine and dine you
Oh I wanna twist and twist and shout
I want you hot in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the key to my heart
Oh when you wear that sweet dress
But you're too physical physical to me
You're just too physical physical no to me
I want your rough house baby
I want this right in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I let you make this feeling clear here
I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I wanna say all those things
That would be better unsaid
But you're too physical physical to me
You're just too physical oh
You're too physical for me
You're too physical to me
You're really jus just too just
Too really fuck no
Too fucking physical
Oh you're too physical
Just too physical
You like to open it up real wide
Then you let everyone come inside
There's always something you've got to hide
So you lied and you lied and you lied
Make sure you grab everything that you need
You got a hole that you've got to feed
Keep trying to fill it all up with your greed
But it bleeds and it bleeds and it bleeds
Well go take a little more
We'll scrape you off the floor
We love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
A great big superstar
Is what you think you are
We love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
Nobody burns quite as bright
Well goddamn, maybe you're right
There's always battles left for you to fight
And you might, you might, you just might
But there is something I've got to say
There is a price you're gonna pay
Try as hard as you can to stay
You're just fading and fading and fading the fuck away
Well go take a little more
We'll scrape you off the floor
We love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
A great big superstar
Is what you think you are
We love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
Well go take a little more
We'll scrape you off the floor
We love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
A great big superstar
Is what you think you are
We love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
Better turn the lights down low
The cracks begin to show
We all love you anyhow
But you're not so pretty now
Well soon you will be gone
And we will all move on
You never mattered anyhow
And you're not so pretty now
smiling in thier faces
while filling up the hole
so many dirty little places
in your filthy little worn out
broken down see through soul
baby's got a problem
tries so hard to hide
got to keep it on the surface
because everything else is dead on the other side
teeth in the necks of everyone you know
you can keep on sucking until the blood won't flow
when it starts to hurt it only helps it grow
taking all you need
but not this time
no, you don't
and just for the record
just so you know
I did not believe
that you could sink so low
you think that you can beat them
I know that you won't
you think you have everything
but no, you don't
no, you don't
no, you don't
no, you don't
no, you don't
You and I, we may look the same, but we are very far apart
There's bullet holes where my compassion used to be, and there's violence in my heart
Into fire you can send us, from the fire we return
You can label us a consequence of how much you have to learn
You can try, but you'll never understand
This is something that you'll never understand
Can you hear it now? Hear it coming now?
Can you hear it now?
On hands and knees we crawl
You can not stop us all
Our bones, our skin
We will not let you win
You have set something in motion, much greater then you've ever known
Standing there in all your grand naivety, about to reap what you have sown
Time will feed upon your weaknesses, and seem to lose the will to care
When you return to the place that you call home, we will be there, we will be there
On hands and knees we crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood will stay
We will not go away
On hands and knees we crawl
You can not stop us all
Our blood, our ways
Will never leave this place
I am the voice inside your head
and I control you
I am the lover in your bed
and I control you
I am the sex that you provide
and I control you
I am the hate you try to hide
and I control you
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down I use you up
I speak religion's message clear
and I control you
I am denial guilt and fear
and I control you
I am the prayers of the naive
and I control you
I am the lie that you believe
and I control you
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down I use you up
I am the needle in your vein
and I control you
I am the high you can't sustain
and I control you
I am the pusher I'm a whore
and I control you
I am the need you have for more
and I control you
I am the bullet in the gun
and I control you
I am the truth from which you run
and I control you
I am the silencing machine
and I control you
I am the end of all your dreams
and I control you
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down I use you up
wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
photographs I took of you
well times I passed through
so many faces
so many places
I have got to have a memory
I have never been there
I have never had you
I can't remember
give me your reminder
now girl... only it's flavor... bow down here
keychains and snowstorms
the taste of your sweat
the look in your eye
I have been inside you
I know what it feels like
wet as it is... the whiter the honey
goodies come in here all day
give me your reminder
I can't remember
Right now in position
Violent as polished steel
This is something different
Don't know how big this feels
No time for asking questions
No time for wondering
We've had enough of you now
You've heard everything
Who wants to play a new game
You put on this blindfold
You do what we tell you
You do as you're told
Used to be the leader
Now comes the time to serve
Maybe we'll show some mercy
Maybe you'll get what you deserve
Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
Right here now my friend, this is your disaster
Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master
You've left quite a mess here under your stewardship
You thought you figured it out but you'll find your place in this
You think its so convincing, you think you see the truth
Give us so many things, now who's got the time for you
Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
Right here now my friend, this is your disaster
Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master
Come on down
Well, it's happening, never planned on this
You've got something I need, kind of dangerous
And I'm losing control, I'm not used to this
What you want from me, I'm not used to this
I can't shut it off, this thing I've begun
And it's hard to tell just where it's coming from
And it's hard to see what I'm capable of
And it's hard to believe just what I've become
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
I can swallow it down, keep it all inside
I define myself by how well I hide
I feel it coming apart, well, at least I tried
I can win this war by knowing not to fight
If I take it all back, some way, somehow
If I knew back then what I know right now
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop? Me, I'm not
i can't believe that what i feel is really happening to me.
make it hurt.
and point the finger at my insecurities.
well i guess i just don't understand about those complexities in your mind.
and i guess i just don't understand why this world seems so unkind.
maybe. maybe just once. i get what's coming.
maybe. maybe just once. i get what's coming to me.
so once again the way you feel will never ever stay the same.
and i'm to blame.
i wonder just who made the rules up for this game.
well i guess i just don't understand about what you want and what you need.
and i guess i just don't understand about how it has to be.
you sat down on this bed and you said
"Christ, what the hell do you think this place is?"
he just couldn't believe it!
and i said
"i don't know but it sure is something different"
so go ahead.
you say those thousand things you think you have to say.
look at me.
and tell me love's not such a hard word anyway.
well how can you count on me i thought you realized for sure.
and how can you just believe.
i thought i deserved just a little more.
oh what's coming to me.
step right up march push
crawl right up on your knees
please greed feed no time to hesitate
I want a little bit I want a piece of it I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
don't like the look of it don't like the taste of it don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down
all the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
take the skin and peel it back
now doesn't that make you feel better?
shove it up inside surprise! lies
stains like the blood on your teeth
bite chew suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up I want to smash it up I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
maybe afraid of it let's discredit it let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
now doesn't that make you feel better?
the pigs have won tonight
now they can all sleep soundly
and everything is all right
gave up trying to figure out my head got lost along the way
worn out from giving it up my soul i pissed it all away
still stings these shattered nerves
pigs we get what pigs deserve
i'm going all the way down i'm leaving today
come come come on you've gotta fill me up
come come gotta let me inside of you
come come come on you're gotta fix me up
come come gotta let me inside of you
still feel it all slipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
everybody's still chipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
look through these blackened eyes
you'll see ten thousand lies
my lips may promise but my heart is a whore
come come come on you've gotta fill me up
come come gotta let me inside of you
come come come on you're gotta fix me up
come come gotta let me get through to you
this isn't meant to last
this is for right now
i know it's all getting away it comes to me as no surprise
i know what's coming to me is never going to arrive
fresh blood through tired skin
new sweat to drown me in
dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive
come come come on you've gotta fill me up
come come gotta let me inside of you
come come come on you're gotta fix me up
come come gotta let me get through to you
this isn't meant to last
this is for right now
i wish i could put the blame on you
i want you to make me
i want you to take me
i want you to break me
then i want you to throw me away
i can't shake this feeling from my head.
there's a devil sleeping in my bed.
watching you from across the way.
i cannot make this feeling go away
i know it's not the right thing.
and I know it's not the good think.
but kinda i want to.
i'm not sure of what i should do.
when every thought i'm thinking of is you.
all of my excuses turn to lies.
maybe God will cover up his eyes
why does it have to be this way?
why does it have to be?
why does have to be this way?
kinda i want to.
maybe just for tonight.
we can pretend it's alright.
what's the price i pay.
i don't care what they say.
i want to.
i want to i'll take my chance tonight
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
talking to myself all the way to the station
pictures in my head of the final destination all lined up
all the one's that aren't allowed to stay
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches
tried to overcome the complications and the catches
nothing ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Watch the sun, as it crawls across a final time
And it feels like, like it was a friend
It is watching us, and the world we set on fire
Do you wonder if it feels the same?
And the sky is filled with light, can you see it?
All the black is really white, if you believe it
As your time is running out, let me take away your doubt
You can find a better a place in this twilight
From dust to dust, ashes in your hair remind me
What it feels like and i won't feel again
Night descends, could I have been a better person?
If i could only do it all again
And the sky is filled with light, do you see it?
All the black is really white if you believe it
And the longing that you feel, you know none of this is real
You will find a better a place in this twilight
as black as the night can get
everything is safer now
there's always a way to forget
once you learn to find a way how
in the blur of serenity
where did everything get lost?
the flowers of naivete
buried in a layer of frost
the smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes
thought he had it all before they called his bluff
found out that his skin just wasn't thick enough
wanted to go back to how it was before
thought he lost everything
then he lost a whole lot more
a fool's devotion
swallowed up in empty space
the tears of regret
frozen to the side of his face
the smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes
I've done all I can do
could I please come with you?
sweet smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes
just like an animal
just like an animal
just like an animal
you let me violate you
you let me desecrate you
you let me penetrate you
you let me complicate you
i broke apart my insides
i've got no soul to sell
the only thing that works for me
help me get away
i wanna fuck you
i wanna taste you
i wanna feel you
i wanna be you
just like an animal
just like an animal
just like an animal
just like an animal
you can have my isolation
you can have the hate that it brings
you can have my absence of faith
you can have my everything
you tear down my all reason
you see through what i hide
you make me perfect
help me get inside
i wanna fuck you
i wanna taste you
i wanna feel you
i wanna be you
i wanna fuck you
i wanna taste you
i wanna feel you
i wanna be you
I'm losing ground
you know how this world can beat you down
I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way
I'm always falling down the same hill
bamboo puncturing this skin
and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
2 feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
and if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
don't you tell me how I feel
don't you tell me how I feel
don't you tell me how I feel
you don't know just how I feel
I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
don't tell me that you care
there really isn't anything, is there?
you would know, wouldn't you?
you extend your hand to those who suffer
to those who know what it really feels like
to those who've had a taste
like that means something
and oh so sick I am
and maybe I don't have a choice
and maybe that is all I have
and maybe this is a cry for help
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
don't you tell me how I feel
don't you tell me how I feel
don't you tell me how I feel
you don't know just how I feel
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but I remember everything
what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feeling disappear
you are someone else
I am still right here
what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
if I could start again
a million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
he sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
he tries to tell me what I put inside of me
he's got the answers to ease my curiosity
he dreamed up a god and called it Christianity
your god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell I will see you there
he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine
his perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
demands devotion atrocities done in his name
your god is dead and no one cares

burning with your god in humility

slave screams he thinks he knows what he wants
slave screams thinks he has something to say
slave screams he hears but doesn't want to listen
slave screams he's being beat into submission
don't open your eyes you won't like what you see
the devils of truth steal the souls of the free
don't open your eyes take it from me
i have found
you can find
happiness is slavery
slave screams he spends his life learning conformity
slave screams he claims he has his own identity
slave screams he's going to cause the system to fall
slave screams but he's glad to be chained to that wall
don't open your eyes you won't like what you see
the blind have been blessed with security
don't open your eyes take it from me
i have found
you can find
happiness is slavery
i don't know what i am i don't know where i've been
human junk just words and so much skin
stick my hands thru the cage of this endless routine
just some flesh caught in this big broken machine
Hey man, please don't make a sound
Take a look around, can't you see what's right in front of you
Have a little taste, no more time to waste
You don't wanna get left behind
Cause it's all coming down right now
How hard is it to see
Put your faith in me
Cause you wouldn't want to be
Nailed to the wrong piece of wood
You should get where you belong
Everything you know is wrong
C'mon, sing along, everybody now
And they gave us sight
And you'll see the light
And it burned so bright
Now you know we're right
But its yet to come
And the work we've done
We've just begun
We're the chosen one
Hey, step into the light
How can this be right?
I'm in front of you
Now ask me to leave
This you cannot win
With the color of your skin
You won't be getting into the Promised Land
It's just another case
Still don't know your place
Step aside, look away, wipe that look of your face
Cause waves of defiance
Come raining from the sky
C'mon, sing along, everybody now
And they gave us sight
And you'll see the light
And it burned so bright
Now you know we're right
But its yet to come
And the work we've done
We've just begun
We're the chosen one

perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most
forgot how it feels well almost
no one to blame always the same
open my eyes wake up in flames
it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me realize
it took you to make me see the light
smashed up my sanity
smashed up my integrity
smashed up what i believed in
smashed up what's left of me
smashed up my everything
smashed up all that was true
gonna smash myself to pieces
i don't know what else to do
covered in hope and vaseline
still cannot fix this broken machine
watching the hole it used to be mine
just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
of the trust i will betray
give it to me i throw it away
after everything i've done i hate myself for what i've become
i gave up
throw it away
I woke up today
to find myself in the other place
with a trail of footprints
from where I ran away
it seems everything I've heard
just might be true
and you know me
well you think you do
sometimes, I have everything  yet I wish I felt something
do you know how far this has gone?
just how damaged have I become?
when I think I can overcome
it runs even deeper
and in a dream I'm a different me
with a perfect you
we fit perfectly
and for once in my life I feel complete
and I still want to ruin it
afraid to look
as clear as day
this plan has long been underway
I hear them call
I cannot stay
the voice inviting me away
do you know how far this has gone?
just how damaged have I become?
when I think I can overcome
it runs even deeper
everything that matters is gone
all the hands of hope have withdrawn
could you try to help me hang on?
I won't crack
on my way
and I can't turn back
I'm on track
on my way
and I can't turn back
on this track
gone too far
and I can't come back
on this track
lost my way
can't come back
kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky and i was feeling some feelings
you wouldn't believe sometimes i don't believe them myself and i decided i was
never coming down. just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about
too small to see. but i watched it way too long and that dot was pulling me
i was up about it.
i was up above it.
now i'm down in it
i was up above it.
i was up above it.
now i'm down in it
well shut up so what what does it matter now. i was swimming in the haze now i
crawl on the ground. and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping
into me. try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works
out "I guess the jokes on me." she said
i used to be so big and strong.
i used to know my right from wrong.
i used to never be afraid.
i used to be somebody
i used to have something inside
now just this hole that's open wide.
i used to want it all
i used to be somebody
i'll cross my heart and hope to die but the needle's already in my eye. and
all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why. and what i
used to think was me is just a fading memory
i looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."

rain rain go away.
come again some other day.
na na na na na na na na.
Someone take these dreams away
that point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true reality
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
When figures from the past stand tall
and mocking voices ring the hall
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadores who took their share
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
you let me violate you, you let me desecrate you
you let me penetrate you, you let me complicate you
help me I broke apart my insides, help me I've got no soul to sell
help me the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself
I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
my whole existence is flawed
you get me closer to god
you can have my isolation, you can have the hate that it brings
you can have my absence of faith, you can have my everything
help me tear down my reason, help me its' your sex I can smell
help me you make me perfect, help me become somebody else
I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
my whole existence is flawed
you get me closer to god
through every forest, above the trees
within my stomach, scraped off my knees
I drink the honey inside your hive
you are the reason I stay alive
I pushed a button and elected you to office
And he pushed a button and it dropped the bomb
You pushed a button and could watch it all on the television
Those motherfuckers didn't last too long
I'm sick of hearing about the haves and the havenots
Have some personal accountability
The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is
The more we let you have the less that I'll be keeping for me
Well, I used to stand for something
Now I'm on my hands and knees
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G
Don't give a shit about the temprature in Guatemela
Don't really see what all the fuss is about
Ain't gonna worry about no future generations
I'm sure somebody gonna figure it out
Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person
You haven't had enough to know it's like
You're only angry cause you wish you were in my position
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right
Well, I used to stand for something
But forgot what that could be
There's a lot of me inside you
Maybe you're afraid to see
I used to stand for something
Now on my hands and kness
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G
I am a big man
yes I am
and I have a big gun
got me a big old Dick and I
I like to have fun
held against your forehead
I'll make you suck it
maybe I'll put a hole in your head
you know, just for the fuck of it
I can reduce you if I want
I can devour
I'm hard as fucking steel, and I've got the power
I'm every inch a man, and I'll show you somehow
me and my fucking gun
nothing can stop me now
shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
I'm going to come all over you
me and my fucking gun
me and my fucking gun
breeze still carries the sound
maybe i'll disappear
tracks will fade in the snow
you won't find me here
ice is starting to form
ending what had begun
i am locked in my head
with what i've done
i know you tried to rescue me
didn't let anyone get in
left with a trace of all that was
and all that could have been
and run far away
far away from me
i am tainted
the two of us
were never meant to be
all these pieces
and left behinds
if only i could see
in my nothing
you meant everything
everything to me
could have been
could have been
and run far away
far as you can see
i am tainted
and peace of mind
were never meant for me
all these pieces
and left behinds
if only i could see
in my nothing
you meant everything
everything to me

I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but I remember everything
what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feeling disappear
you are someone else
I am still right here
what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
if I could start again
a million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
you let me violate you, you let me desecrate you
you let me penetrate you, you let me complicate you
help me I broke apart my insides, help me I've got no soul to sell
help me the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself

you get me closer to god
through every forest, above the trees
within my stomach, scraped off my knees
I drink the honey inside your hive
you are the reason I stay alive
It must be your skin that I'm sinking in
It must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind
It's not my kind, it's not my time to wonder why
Everything gone white
Now you're here Now you're away
I don't want this
I'll never forget where you're at
Don't let the days go by
I'm never alone
I'm alone all the time
Are you at one, or do you lie
We live in a wheel where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields
I treated you bad, you bruise my face
i couldn't love you more you've got a beautiful taste
Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
It should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me
Don't let the days go by
Don't let the days go by....
Bad moon white again
Bad moon white again
As she falls around me
I needed you more when you wanted us less
I could not kiss, just regress
It might just be clear simple and plain
Well that's just fine that's just one of my names
Don't let the days go by
It could've been easier on you you you
Glycerine, Glycerine, Glycerine, Glycerine
Sink down in myriads
Are you aware of a creator?
Bitter inward stride against distress
Privation of pain and sorrow
If a life tomorrow becomes
The grave is dug today
Saved from waves of time we float
Against distant hights in the blue
Your spirit lifeless body animates
And by the ashes seal your fate
Bit by bit my body will decay
In the dark hole called my grave I will not stay
In my rotten brain the will to live remain
Now I am deceased and you are left alive
But in truth I am the living one and you're the one to die
Now I am all alone and only the clouds will hear me cry
I will rise again...
Alone I embrace myself
I will claim my revenge
I would never bother you
I would never promise to
I would never follow you
I would never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never felt this well
I have never felt so frail
I have never failed to feel
I have never felt to feel
I have never failed to fail
You know you're right x3
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Sterling silver begins to melt
Steaming soup against her mouth
Steaming soup begins to melt
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never felt this well
I have never felt so frail
I have never failed to feel
I have never felt to feel
I have never failed to fail
You know you're right x17
I don't need to love again
I won't sigh and mope again
I don't need to love again
I just don't think it's worth it
I don't really love her
I don't think I want her
Ain't gonna take to love again
It's the way your love hurts
It's the way your mad again
I don't think I'll love again
I won't ever promise her
I don't think I want her
This time no one else
I don't bear to follow you
I don't ever promise you
Sometimes I don't love you
Think I'm tired of loving her
I don't really want love
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You told me to follow him
Teach him that I loved him
I won't ever promise you
I won't even bother to
You gave me my first kiss
I don't think I want it now
I don't ever want again
It's all that I had to have
It's all that I wanted
It's all that I had to
I don't think I'll miss her
I don't think I want her
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I'm gonna move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
You know you're right x3
It's so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup begins to melt
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
Ii'm gonna move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No Thought was put into this

Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Take a step outside yourself
And you turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
You're not much
You can't do anything
Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is revolting
You're really nowhere
Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let them do it
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking!?
It's pretty scary, it's so revolting x4
Take a step outside the country
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's a laugh
Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and around
Take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary
Mayday every day, in my heart.
Could've had a heart attack, in my heart.
We don't know anything, in my heart.
We all want something fair, in my heart.
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart.
Queen of lies, everyday, in my heart.
My heart, one more on the phone, my heart.
One more at the phone, at my heart
Mean heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart!
I'm not gonna make it through
Something else is something new
I'm not gonna make it dream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make it through
It's something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make it through
It's something else, it's something new
Hold it in your gut
I'm not gonna make it through
Something else is something new
I'm not gonna make it scream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make it through
Something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make it dream
In this house it's something mean
Hold it in your gut
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
One day when I lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
They whooped him up the hill
They whooped him up the hill for me
One day when I lost
They hung him on a cross
They whooped him up the hill for me
They never said among them would
They never said among them would for me
One day when I lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
They bit him in the side
They bit him in the side for me
One day when I lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
They hung his head and died
We hung his head and died for me
One day when I lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
Fight tuberculosis, folks." Christmas Eve, an old
junkie selling Christmas seals on North Park Street.
The "Priest," they called him. "Fight tuberculosis, folks."
People hurried by, gray shadows on a distant wall.
It was getting late and no money to score.
He turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife.
Cab stop just ahead under a streetlight.
Boy got out with a suitcase. Thin kid in prep school clothes,
familiar face, the Priest told himself, watching from the doorway.
"Remindsme of something a long time ago." The boy, there, with his overcoat
unbuttoned, reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare.
The cab drove away and turned the corner. The boy went inside
a building. "Hmm, yes, maybe"  the suitcase was there in the doorway.
The boy nowhere in sight. Gone to get the keys, most likely,
have to move fast. He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner.
Made it. Glanced down at the case. It didn't look like the case the boy had,
or any boy would have. The Priest couldn't put his finger on what was so
old about the case. Old and dirty, poor quality leather, and heavy.
Better see what's inside. He turned into Lincoln Park, found an
empty place and opened the case. Two severed human legs that belonged to
a young man with dark skin. Shiny black leg hairs glittered in the
dim streetlight. The legs had been forced into the case and he had to use
his knee on the back of the case to shove them out. "Legs, yet,"
he said, and walked quickly away with the case.
Might bring a few dollars to score. The buyer sniffed suspiciously.
"Kind of a funny smell about it." "It's just Mexican leather."
"Well, some joker didn't cure it."
The buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor.
"Not even right sure he killed it, whatever it is.
Three is the best I can do and it hurts. But since this is Christmas
and you're the Priest..." he slipped three bills under the table into the
Priest's dirty hand. The Priest faded into the street shadows, seedy
and furtive. Three cents didn't buy a bag, nothing less than a nickel.
Say, remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back unless
I paid him the three cents I owe him. Yeah, isn't that a fruit for ya,
blow your stack about three lousy cents.
The doctor was not pleased to see him.
"Now, what do you WANT? I TOLD you!"
The Priest laid three bills on the table. The doctor put the
money in his pocket and started to scream.
"I've had TROUBLES! PEOPLE have been around!
I may lose my LICENSE!" The Priest just sat there, eyes, old and heavy with
years of junk, on the doctor's face.
"I can't write you a prescription." The doctor jerked open a drawer
and slid an ampule across the table. "That's all I have in the OFFICE!"
The doctor stood up. "Take it and GET OUT!" he screamed, hysterical.
The Priest's expression did not change.
The doctor added in quieter tones, "After all, I'm a professional man,
and I shouldn't be bothered by people like you."
"Is that all you have for me? One lousy quarter G? Couldn't you lend
me a nickel...?" "Get out, get out, I'll call the police I tell you."
"All right, doctor, I'm going." Of course it was cold and far to walk,
rooming house, a shabby street, room on the top floor.
"These stairs," coughed the Priest there, pulling himself up along the
bannister. He went into the bathroom, yellow wall panels,
toilet dripping, and got his works from under the washbasin.
Wrapped in brown paper, back to his room, get every drop in the dropper.
He rolled up his sleeve. Then he heard a groan from next door,
room eighteen. The Mexican kid lived there, the Priest had passed him on
the stairs and saw the kid was hooked, but he never spoke, because he
didn't want any juvenile connections, bad news in any language.
The Priest had had enough bad news in his life.
He heard the groan again, a groan he could feel, no mistaking that groan
and what it meant. "Maybe he had an accident or something.
In any case, I can't enjoy my priestly medications with that sound coming
through the wall." Thin walls you understand. The Priest put down his
dropper, cold hall, and knocked on the door of room eighteen.
"Quien es?" "It's the Preist, kid, I live next door."
He could hear someone hobbling across the floor.
A bolt slid. The boy stood there in his underwear shorts, eyes black with
pain. He started to fall. The Priest helped him over to the bed.
"What's wrong, son?" "It's my legs, senor, cramps, and now I am without
medicine." The Priest could see the cramps, like knots of wood there
in the young legs, dark shiny black leg hairs.
"A few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race,
it was then that the cramps started." And now he has the leg cramps back
with compound junk interest. The old Priest stood there, feeling the boy
groan. He inclined his head as if in prayer, went back and got his dropper.
"It's just a quarter G, kid." "I do not require much, senor."
The boy was sleeping when the Priest left room eighteen.
He went back to his room and sat down on the bed.
Then it hit him like heavy silent snow. All the gray junk yesterdays.
He sat there received the immaculate fix. And since he was himself a priest,
there was no need to call one.
We passed upon the stair,we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there,he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone,a long long time ago
Oh no,not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World
I laughed and shook his hand,and made my way back home
I searched for form and land,for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here
We must have died along,a long long time ago
Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when

You're face to face

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
I must have died alone Alt I must have died along
A long, long time ago
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World
Originally by David BowieAt all the millions here
This is the end
My only friend, the end
This is the end
My only friend, the end
I'll offer you some
I'll offer you sexualism and a masculine man
You can rephrase my friend Alt You can deface my grave, my friend
The killer woke up in Belgium
And he poured alot of syrup on his waffles
And he walked on down the hall
And he said, all I want is to have some hasbrowns and some grits
And then he walked on down the hall
And then he said, listen I got a quarter in my pocket
And I see that waffle house jukebox
And I'm gonna walk up to the coinslot
And then there's a direst line between my pupil and that cionslot
And I lift that quarter out of my pocket
And I said, I wanna hear the waffle house theme
So I walk up to the jukebox, And I said
Come on in
I believe I will, I believe I will
At the waffle house
I got a six pack and nothin' to do
Time has come we grow
Impatiently we hunger
We open our gleaming eyes
And from your troubles arise
Time has come I've lost
All I wanted I took at any cost
Everything I loved is gone
Endless greed for wealth and power
For what purpose when my love of life's devoured
I spill a silent tear for what's to be done
So be it your existence shall be mine
Soul departs from body
I will call you servant and you'll call me divine
Inverted visions in your watery eyes
Heed your father's call
There's no need for any lies
Time to die...
"Come on people now, smile on your brother and
everybody get together, try to love one another right now"
When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way  a better way  I had better wait
Never met a wise man, if so it's a woman
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way  a better way  I had better wait
"Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you"
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way  a better way  I had better wait
Shake it down easy, shake it down sleazy, come on
Shake it down easy, shake yourself, Suzy, come on
Don't let me detain you
Try to ride along
Don't you lie, knowing
I am not sad
I am not silly
I am not chippin'
I am not chippin' away
Talk to me
In your own language, please
In your own
Talk to me
In your own language please
Shake it down easy, make it sound seamy, doll man
Make it sound now, make it full house, sad man
Leader of the band
Makes a mental hell
I won't weather it well
Well I never
Saw it with my arm
Paint it with my heart
Paint it with my eyes and make it right
Lay down easy, lay it down seamy, sad man
Lay down easy, lay it down seamy, sad man
You don't want to hear this
Nothin' but a whore
I will play the leader
Now you know I'm needy
Lay them down easy
Lay them down easy
Talk to me
In your own language please
They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
 Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
 Keeps her photographs close to her heart
 Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I'd  rather be dead than cool
I don't know why  every line ends in rhyme
I don't know why  less is more, love is blind
I don't know why
Stay away x3
Give an inch, take a smile
I don't know why  fashion shits, fashion style
I don't know why  throw it out and keep it in
I don't know why  have to have poison skin
I don't know why

God is gay!
To hope is admittance
Feed before beginning
Don't be so selfish
Leaving me this
Follow it far
To find where you are
You haven't grown
Go on alone
Never finished his sentence
Remained in seclusion
For the next few days
Family is circuling
He having moved up
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly
Looking for company
And as the soft pretentious mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
And the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
living without you girl you'll only break my heart ...
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it  I can shape it andor mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it  I can spank it, I can beat it ejaculate it ... Aah!
I've been lookin for day Glo  Always hearing the same ole'
Sticky boredom with a book 
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could

The seal has been broken the last door is shut
Whirling in the slumbering dephts
A pale gleaming
The last lantern in the darkness to come
Rising from the veils of slumber
to reap the dark souls and bring blessing to some
I fall to my knees
The holy chapel is ablaze
We cry out in bitterness as we watch the fall of the human race
Behold the living
Call forth the dead
Images have taken form inside your swollen head
I laugh at your cries
All that was lost now will be found
The cattle has been branded
As holy lambs for slaughter you lie bound
Galactic eyes see beyond
Gazing at the stars that ancient Gods lit
All is nothing and nothing is all
Now sleep you will eternally
Into veils of dark you fall...
Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please, don't go

Go outside and ride your bike
Thats what I did, I killed my toe

I woke up in my mother's arms

Bye bye baby, bye bye bird!
Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special
And you look like you're the best
Her name is rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on tv
Two of a billion stars it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you
Hey now look at that did he nearly run you down
at the end of the drive the lawmen arrive you make me feel
Alive, alive, alive
I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side
I tell you something I know what you're thinking
I tell you something I know what you're thinking
Her name is rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh rio rio dance across the rio grande
Her name is rio she don't need to understand
I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh rio rio hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the north down to the rio grande

A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns
What is wrong with me x3
I'm gonna do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bipolar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Secondrate third degree burns
What is wrong with me x2
What do I think of me ?
Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth
What is wrong with me x3
What do I think of me ?
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
What is wrong with me x3
What do I think of me ?
Polly wants a cracker. Think I should get off her first.

She asks me to untie her. A chase would be nice for a few.
Polly says her back hurts. And she's just as bored as me.
She caugh me off my guard. It amazes me, the will of instinct.

Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
When you've finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work it was fun
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some said it was in Greenland and some say Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

When my feeding time
She push food through the door
I crawl towards the cracks of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down
The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they  and twitch and masturbate!
I said so x3
Black windows are paint
I scratch with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point at my way
The older ones come with lights
And take my family away
And very later I have learned
To accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence was for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you!
To take you
With me to
Your eyes ...
Congratulation you have won
it's a year subscription of bad puns.
And it makes your story our concern
and you set it up for returns
My opinions.Mmm mmm x4
And there seems to be a problem here
Your state of emotion seems to clear
You rise and fall like wall street stock
And they had an affect on our happy talk
Our opinions.Mmm mmm x2

I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I won't move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to feel
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
stinging skin begins to melt
Nothing ever bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it would come to this

I don't need to love again
I won't sigh and mope again
I don't need to love again
I just don't think it's worth it
I don't really love her
I don't think I want her
Ain't gonna take to love again
It's the way your love hurts
It's the way your mad again
I don't think I'll love again
I won't ever promise her
I don't think I want her

I don't really want love
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You told me to follow him
Teach him that I loved him
I won't ever promise you
I won't even bother to
You gave me my first kiss
I don't think I want it now
I don't ever want again
It's all that I had to have
It's all that I wanted
It's all that I had to
I don't think I'll miss her
I don't think I want her
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high that I scratched 'till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
My Brother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, then I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

In every way I love you,
Help me know,

She seems to think
She seems too weak
She takes a week to get over it
She likes the sea
She likes to see
She likes to think she has all of it
She likes the sound
She likes the sand
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
She likes to be
She's into guilt
She likes to think

She seems too weak, she takes all the rent
She likes the time
she owns the time
She borrows time to selfinvent

She likes to sit
she likes to go
She likes to be

If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth?
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect

oh yeah,I believe I can touch the stars

Maybe one dayx1
We can be in love,
but until then
maybe we can...
Close the door put out the light,
You know they won't be home tonight.
The snow falls hard and don't you know,
The winds of Thor are blowing cold.
They're wearing steel that's bright and true.
They carry news that must get through.
They choose the path where no one goes.
They hold no quarter.
They hold no quarter.
Walking side by side with death,
The devil mocks their every step.
The snow drives back the foot that's slow,
The dogs of doom are howling more.
They carry news that must get through,
To build a dream for me and you.
They choose the path where no one goes.
They hold no quarter.
They ask no quarter.
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again

Always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Theres talk about someone else
Steaming soup begins to melt
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself
I will move away from here
You wont be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew to come like this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
Live baby live
Now that the day is over
I got a new sensation
In perfect moments
Impossible to refuse
Sleep baby sleep
Now that the night is over
And the sun comes like a god
Into our room
All perfect light and promises
Gotta hold on you
A new sensation
A new sensation
Gonna take you over
A new sensation
A new sensation
Dream baby dream
Of all that's come and going
And you will find out
In the end
There really is
There really is no difference
Cry baby cry
When you've got to get it out
I'll be your shoulder
You can tell me all
Don't keep it in ya
Well that's the reason why I'm here
Are you ready for a new sensation
A new sensation
Gonna take you on a new sensation
A new sensation
Hate baby hate
When there's nothing left for you
You're only human
What can you do
It'll soon be over
Don't let your pain take over you
Love baby love
It's written all over your face
There's nothing better we could do
Than live forever
Well that's all we've got to do
Hey now I'm gonna take a new sensation
A new sensation

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me,
Tell me where did you sleep last night.
In the pines, in the pines,
Where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through.
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows.
In the pines in the pines,
where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through
Her husband, was a hard working man,
Just about a mile from here.
His head was found in a driving wheel,
But his body never was found.
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me,
Tell me where did you sleep last night.

You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
Here she comes again
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
She'll make you flip
Here she comes again
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
You kinda like the way she dips
She's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl
And she used to be mine
You've got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
And when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes I eat cow  I am not proud.
Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and keep it clean
Yes I eat cow  I am not proud
Is he in an easychair? Alt Easy in an easy chair
 Poop as hard as a rock.
I don't like you anyway
 Seal it in a box
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes I eat cow  I am not proud.
Show me how you question, question

She'd take me anywhere

As long as she stays with me

As long as I stayed clean
Kiss kiss Molly's lips x4 and x8 in the end
She had a moist vagina
I particularly enjoy the circumference
sucking the warts of her anus
I preferred her to any other
I prefered her to any other
I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins
Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron andor sleeping
I own my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit it is her milk
Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron andor sleeping
Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side

Protector of the kennel
Obituary every birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery!
All the itchy flakes, it is a flaming
All the gels and cremes it is pertaining
To a fungus mold cured by injection
Hope it's only ah, a yeast infection
Oh well, it burns when I  it hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I  it hurts when I see
Now I vomit  and diarrhoea
On the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy
Puss, I feel the blood becoming chowder rust
Oh well, it burns when I  it hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I  it hurts when I see
Roll into my bed which does consist of
Lice, bugs and fleas and yellow mucus
Stained dirt, vaseline, toe jam and booger
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge
She had a moist vagina
I particularly enjoy the circumference
I'll be sucking the walls of her anus
I preferred her to any other
I prefered her to any other
He's there in case I want it all

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
I really love you baby
I love what you've got
Let's get together, we can
No more tomorrow, baby
Time is today
Girl, I can make you feel
No place for hidin' baby

Love gun, love gun
Love gun, love gun
You can't forget me baby
Don't try to lie
You'll never leave me, mama
So don't try
I'll be a gambler, baby
Lay down the bet
We get together, mama
No place for hidin' baby
No place to run
You pull the trigger of my
Love gun, love gun repeated several times
Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
Would you believe me when I do you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
Truth  covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to, but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
I still smell her on you
Don't  tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's  gone

I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you ...
We've broken our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care ...
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze ...
'Cause I've found god
Yeah, yeah x6
I like it  I'm not gonna crack
I miss you  I'm not gonna crack
I love you  I'm not gonna crack
I kill you  Im not gonna crack
I like it  I'm not gonna crack
I miss you  I'm not gonna crack
I love you  I'm not gonna crack
I kill you  I'm not gonna crack
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July

I'm long gone from vertical,
Somewhere south is stopping me
I'm long gone from the american dream,
You may decide it's something new
I'm long gone but I'll let you through,
You may decide it's not for you.
I'm long gone but I'll let you through,
You may decide there's nothing there
Hold it in your gut x8 Alt Born in a junkyard
I'm long gone but I'll let you through,
You may decide that it's not good
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave,
You may decide on stopping me
I'm long gone but I'll let you lose,
You may decide it's something new
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave,
You may decide on stopping me.

Fly away into the morning
trying to find some pain
I am on the same mountain
the place where Jesus began.
The sun's so low and it's bad to know
it'll never come up again
jim still loves death as much
as I love this life
but my story is closing
in front of my own eyes
coz the sun's so low and it's bad to know
it'll never come up again
Driven conversations, even I can read
Wouldn't want to fake it, and I'm tired of this dream
Taking medications, in the back of the room
Driven conversations, he died in June.
See the stab wounds in his hands
See him dying in his room
He's dying in his room
He's dying in his room
Heading for me, heading this way
He is coming, I don't care
Wouldn't want to fake it, well I don't mind
Giving conversations to a friend of mine
Giving medications, in a lighted room
Wouldn't want to fake it, I know I should
See the stab wounds in his hands
You killed him, I don't care
Keep a promise, you would too
Keep a promise, even you
See the silence in his head
He is coming, I don't care
We're not gonna make it, well I don't mind
Wouldn't want to fake it, but I have this time
Giving conversations, to whom they don't know
Taking medications till my stomach's full.
See a famine in his head
See him coming at their heels
He loves you, give him a chance
I don't love him, I don't care
See him starving, give her hell
It is over, we don't care In His Room
Sell the kids for food
 weather changes moods
Spring is here again

We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
The hammer of the gods,
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde singing and crying
"Valhalla I am coming!"
On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
Sultry fields of green,
Whispered tales of lore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war,
We are your overlords.
On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day despite all your losing
I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven plight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego?
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or story line
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?
If you want to put off an image
And you miss, the extremes
The extremes, act it out
Onto me x3
I will wade, in the fire
To explain, your asylum
Idle times, analyzing
We'll compare, all our sightings, come on
I speak, to hear, my voice
I can read, I can write
I can breathe, proven fact
Bless my greed, crease unfold
Is it me, or my ego
Write some words, make them rhyme
Pieces for assembly line
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude
If you want, to belong
And you miss, the extremes
The extremes, act it out
Unto to me
I will wade, in the fire
To explain, your asylum
Idle times, analyzing
We'll compare, all our sightings, come on!
I speak to hear my voice

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still havent had my fulfill
In the someday what's that sound?
Broken heart and broken bones
Think of how a castrated horse feels
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
In the someday what's that sound?
 Spoken interlude in middle 
Most people don't realize
That two large pieces of coral,
Painted brown, and attached to his skull
With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer
Baby's good to me you know
She's happy as can be, you know

Hey fellas have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town.
It won't take long just watch and see,
All the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is the same,
As it was so long ago.
But from her eyes a different smile,
Like that of one who knows.
Well it's been ten years and maybe more,
Since I first set eyes on you.
The best years of my life gone by,
Here I am alone and blue.
Some people cry and some people die,
By the wicked ways of love.
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With no grace from the Lord above
People talking all around,
About the way you left me flat.
I don't care what the people say,
I know where their jive is at.
One thing I do have on my mind,
If you can clarify please do,
It's the way you call me by another guy's name,
When I try to make love to you.
Work so hard I couldn't unwind,
Get some money saved.
Abuse my love a thousand times,
However hard I tried.
Heartbreaker your time has come,
Can't take your evil way.
Go away heartbreaker
She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your HeartShaped box for a week
I was drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back
I've got a new conplaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your prieless advice
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Meateating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
And if you save yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
And you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy now
You're really in a laundry room
You're really in a laundry room
The clue just came to you, oh
And if you cut yourself
You will think you're happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll make him happy
He'll give you breathing holes
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass
Then you'll think you're happy now
You're really in a laundry room
You're really in a laundry room
The clue that came to you, oh
You're really in a laundry room
You're really in a laundry room
The clue that came to you, oh
And if you fool yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
Then you will seem happy
You'll wallow in his shit
Then you'll think you're happy now
You're really in a laundry room
You're really in a laundry room
You're really in a laundry room
The clue that came to you, oh
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme
Take time with a wounded hand
'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'cause it likes to heal, I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to me
This I feel as the dawn
It fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be
Think I'll start a fire
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me
Take time with a wounded hand
'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'cause it likes to heal, I like to steal
I'm half the man I used to me
This I feel as the dawn

I was born in the wagon of a travelling show
My momma used to dance for the money they'd throw
Poppa would do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good
Gypsies tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us
Gypsies tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Picked up a boy just south of mobile
Gave him a ride filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen he was twenty one
Rode with us to memphis
And poppa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done
Gypsies tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us
Gypsies tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
She was born in the wagon of a travelling show
Her momma had to dance for the money they'd throw
Grandpa'd do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good
Gypsies tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us
Gypsies tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Fuck it all

It must be your skin that I'm sinking in
It must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind
It's not my kind, it's not my time to wonder why
Everything gone white
Now you're here Now you're away
I don't want this
I'll never forget where you're at
Don't let the days go by
I'm never alone
I'm alone all the time
Are you at one, or do you lie
We live in a wheel where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields
I treated you bad, you bruise my face
i couldn't love you more you've got a beautiful taste
Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
It should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me
Don't let the days go by
Don't let the days go by....
Bad moon white again
Bad moon white again
As she falls around me
I needed you more when you wanted us less
I could not kiss, just regress
It might just be clear simple and plain
Well that's just fine that's just one of my names
Don't let the days go by
It could've been easier on you you you

It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
that you're only supposed to use once and then discard.
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend.
My shyness, pet her flow.
She's only been five months laid,
even though we haven't had sex for a week.
A meal a day, a meal, I say.
And my heart's made my
Somebody else already used the word aurora borealis.
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer.
She's only five weeks laid,
and I haven't had a date forever
Wish I had more...more opportunity,
more chances to remember some things
so I couldn't have so much pressure on my...
on my...on my, um...ah, on my...um...um...head.
We'd have so much more diversity,
and so much more input, so much more creative flow,
if we had someone in school, a GIT
Ha!...Come on, Dave, think of one

It should be GIC, geeks with Charvels
Fuck, man, this is a waste of time!

You're personally responsible for
the entire strip...to be washed away
cleansed...as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
flowed through the strip and were set on fire.
It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight.
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom,
and he...he erected a beautiful city
a city of stars.
It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same
I miss the comfort in being sad x3
In her false witness, we hope you're still with us,
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience,
Diseasecovered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars,
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground
I miss the comfort in being sad x3
It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To know that you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same

Hello Cobain. Come on in. Floyd observes my hairy chin.
Sit down in the chair don't be afraid. Steamed hot towel on my face.
I was shaved. x3
Barney ties me to the chair. I can't see I'm really scared.
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip. Peepee pressed against my lips.
I was shaved. x3
I sense others in the room. Opie, Aunt be I presume.
They take turns and cut me up. I die smothered in Andy's snot.
I was shave. x3
Even in his youth, even in his youth
Even in his youth, he was nothing
Kept his body clean, kept his body clean
Kept his body clean, going nowhere
Daddy was ashamed daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed, he was something
Disgraced the family name, Disgraced the family name,
He was something
He was born, for your crew
I've got nothing left to prove

One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless
It is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
'cause I like you
With eyes so dilated
I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
'cause I like you

Baby you're going Down In The Dark
Show my lonely night is fallen and I don't have very long
Within my face might burn
You're gonna make it better for a little while
Baby you're gonna die someday
See you in your crowded wasted , then you start to fade
That when we start singing faster
I wouldn't wait so long
Won't get any easier in the Dark
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeahh
You Will, You Will, You Will....
To hope is admittance
Feed before beginning
Don't be so selfish
Leave in me this
Follow it far
To find where you are
You haven't grown
Go on alone
Never finished his sentence
Remained in seclusion
For the next few days
The family circle noose
He had removed us
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly
Looking for company

Been dazed and confused for so long
It's not true,
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.
Lots of people talk and few of them know,
Soul of a woman was created below.
You hurt and abused telling all of your lies,
Run arounds sweet baby lord how they hypnotize.
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been,
Gonna love you baby here I come again
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby but you push me away.
Don't know where you're going only know just where you've been,
Sweet little baby I want you again.
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true,
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.
Take it easy baby let them say what they will.
Won't hurt so much when I send you the bill
Straight as an arrow
Not straight, not so straight
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
Straight as an arrow
Not straight, not so straight
So dumb, so dumb
Dimension Seven x7
I can't hide, no

All I have grown
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
And not seen
At the seams
I'm a lender
I'm a planter
I put something
In the garden
In the handle
On the mantle
I met Santa
I met God
I'm a lady
Can you save me?
It's the sulfur
I have grown
'Tis the season
I'm all reason
I have fleas

For a new kind lover
Not a girl made of rubber
Someone who can make me feel how I wanna feel
And tells me all the things that I wanna hear
It makes me lose control, it makes me go insane
I wanna a girl that does cocaine
Screwed up, its how she needs to be
With no clue of reality
Just wanted you to make me feel how I wanna feel
And tell me all the things, that I wanna hear
It makes me lose control, it makes me go insane
I wanna a girl that does cocaine
And now I'm washed up,
I've had my fun...
Clean up before she comes x5

Devouring my last rites,
without thoughts of changing,
to have my life taken away,
inheriting the skills of,
the dead to hunt and live,
the dead to hunt and die,
because that is our only way,
tomorrow never comes,
waiting and believing,
that they have got it wrong,
why are we made to suffer,
for their ignorance,
to me it makes no sense,
Devouring my last rites,
without thoughts of changing,
to have my life taken away.

Don't trust the foams

Spanning down stream el Rancho ovulate
Feeding a cow hamburger and raw

Homesick a bay aboard the love boat

Beauty on the fire
Here it comes again
Cannot out run my desire
Cover my decent
And throw the beauty on the fire
Drawn towards the edge
Do I assume I could fly
Every secret shared
Why do I drink the feelings dry
Don't go too far
Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown, my soul in Sensory
Pleasure, Sensory, pleasure
Here it comes again
You raise the bar even higher
I cannot catch my breath
So throw the beauty on the fire
Dont push too hard
Beans, beans, beans

He was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some wine
Beans, beans, beans

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today
Don't go 'round tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a blowin'
I know the end is commin' soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we'er in for nasty weather

Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
Don't grab your wallet
It's only major label wasteland.

Everyone wants to try to gun you gun you down in pain
Want to see you try to play
I want to describe you
Put your name as a national woman
I don't like your coffee
I want to have your friendship
As a jock, and to the top
Way, way, way, way

Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off of her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch
It isn't me
We have some seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself
I've got some rope
You have been told
I promise you
I have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few
It isn't me

@SONG Drain You
One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless
It is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
'cause I like you
With eyes so dilated
I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
'cause I like you

What's a season in a right if you can't have anything
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything
What's the meaning in a crime, it's a fan if anything
Where's the learning in a line, it's a brand, it's a brand
How a culture comes again, it was all here yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
There's only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans
They'll be fans alt If you brand x3
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways
Hey ... x7
Seit Jimmy zu den Sternen ging
steh' ich oft am Fenster
denk' an ihn.
Ist sein Zimmer jetzt auch kalt und leer
seine Träume sind noch immer hier
hier sprach er oft mit dem Wind
er war anders als so viele sind
und hier hat er oft allein gerspürt
daß seine Straße zu den Sternen führt.
Vielleicht ist dort dein Leben
vielleicht wird man dir dort Liebe geben
vielleicht ist dort die Freiheit
die du niemals fandst in deinem Leben
vielleicht gibt's dort kein Weinen
vielleicht läßt man dich dort endlich träumen
vielleicht ist dort der Frieden
dann werd' ich ihn dort auch einmal finden.
Seit Jimmy zu den Sternen ging
spür ich jeden Traum von ihm in mir
und die Angst
die immer bei ihm war
ist auch mir in manchen Nächten nah.
Wie oft hat er davon erzählt
wie es sein muß in der andern Welt
daß ich das noch nicht versteh'
bis ich selber zu den Sternen geh'.
Vielleicht ist dort dein Leben
Vielleicht ist dort dein Leben

Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
When you've finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work it was fun
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some said it was in Greenland and some say Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

Know I've been changed
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Lord knows I've been converted
Lord knows I've been redeemed
Well, you can wake me up in the midnight hour
I'm gonna tell ya just a what I seen
I said I know I've been changed
And I know I've been changed, yeah
Know I've been changed
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name

I'm on a black elevator
Little Joe from Kokomo
It rattles to the ground
The dice is laughin at the
man that he throwed
Your rollin over to the
Lowside of the road.
The moon is red and your
Dancin real slow
29 miles left to go
The chain momkeys
Help you with your load
You're rollin over to the
Lowside of the road
Jezebel is naked
With an axe
The prosecution tell you
Your head feels like it's ready
You're rollin over, you're rollin over
Well the clapper has been ripped
Out of the bell
The flapper has been kicked right
Out of hell
When the horse whips the
Man that he rode
You're rollin over to the Lowside of the road
The dog won't bite if you beat
Him with a bone
She's so shy when she's
Talkin on the phone
The round rises up and starts to groan
You're rollin over to the
Lowside of the road
Tom WaitsK. Brennan
They're lining up
To mad dog your tilta whirl
3 shots for a dollar
Win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell
I believed them so well. Take them back
Take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
I did my time
In the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know
Where she should turn
Tell me...what did you do
What did you do the last time?
Why don't you do that
Go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend
Do you cry. Do you pray
Do you wish them away
Do you still leave nothing
But bones in the way
Did you bury the carnival
Lions and all
Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
And just who are you this time?
You look rather tired
Who drinks from your shoe
Are you pretending to love
Well I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and your
Sleeping pills go?
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?
Well I fell in love
With your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes
You better get down on the floor
Don't you know this is war
Tell me who are you this time?
Tell me who are you this time?
well i come in on a night train
with an arm full of box cars
on the wings of a magpie
cross a hooligan night
and i busted up a chifforobe
way out by the cocomo
cooked up a mess a mulligan
and got into a fight
whistlin' past the graveyard
steppin' on a crack
i'm a mean motherhubbard
papa one eyes jack
you probably seen me sleepin'
out by the railroad tracks
go on and ask the prince of darkness
what about all thet smoke
come from the stack
sometimes i kill myself a jackel
suck out all the blood
steal myself a stationwagon
drivin' through the mud
whistlin' past the graveyard
steppin' on a crack
i'm mean motherhubbard
papa one eyed jack
i know you seen my headlights
and the honkin' of my horn
i'm callin' out my bloodhounds
chase the devil through the corn
last night i chugged the mississippi
now that suckers dry as a bone
born in a taxi cab
i'm never comin' home
whistlin' past the graveyard
steppin' on a crack
i'm mean motherhubbard
papa one eyed jack
myeyes have seen the glory
of the drainin' og the ditch
i only come to baton rouge
to find myself a witch
i'mona snatch me up a
couple of em every time itrains
you see a locomotive
probably thinkin' its a train
whistlin' past the graveyard
steppin' on a crack
i'm a mean motherhubbard
papa one eyed jack
what you think is the sunshine
is just a twinkle in my eye
that ring around my fingers
just the 4th of july
when i get a little bit lonesome
and a tear falls from my check
theres gonna be an ocean in
the middle of the week
whistlin' past the graveyard
steppin' on a crack
i'm mean motherhubbard
papa one eyed jack
i rode into town on a night train
with an arm full of box cars
on the wings of a magpie
cross a hooligan night
i'mona tear me off a rainbow
and wear it for a tie
i never told the truth
so i can never tell a lie
whistlin' past the graveyard
steppin' on a crack
i'm mean motherhubbard
papa one eyed jack
I've grown up here now
All of my life
But I dreamed
Someday I'd go
Where blue eyed girls
And red guitars and
Naked rivers flow
I'm not all I thought I'd be
I always stayed around
I've been as far as Mercy and Grand
Frozen to the ground
I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave
Just kiss me once and then
I'll go to hell
I might as well
Be whistlin' down the wind
The bus at the corner
The clock's on the wall
There's no wind at all
I've yelled and I cursed
If i stay here I'll rust
I'm stuck like a shipwreck
Out here in the dust
Sky is red
And there world's on fire
And the corn is taller than me
The dog is tied
To a wagon of rain
And the road is as wet as the sea
And sometimes the music from a dance
Will carry across the plains
And the places that I'm dreaming of
Do they dream only of me?
There are places where they never sleep
And the circus never ends
So I will take the Marley Bone Coach
And whistle down the wind
What's he building in there?
What the hell is he building
He has subscriptions to those
Magazines... He never
Waves when he goes by
He's hiding something from
The rest of us... He's all
To himself... I think I know
Why... He took down the
Tire swing from the Peppertree
He has no children of his
Own you see... He has no dog
And he has no friends and
His lawn is dying... and
What about all those packages
He sends. What's he building in there?
With that hook light
On the stairs. What's he building
In there... I'll tell you one thing
He's not building a playhouse for
The children what's he building
Now what's that sound from under the door?
He's pounding nails into a
Hardwood floor... and I
Swear to god I heard someone
Moaning low... and I keep
Seeing the blue light of a
He has a router
And a table saw... and you
Won't believe what Mr. Sticha saw
There's poison underneath the sink
Of course... But there's also
Enough formaldehyde to choke
A horse... What's he building
In there. What the hell is he
Building in there? I heard he
Has an exwife in some place
Called Mayors Income, Tennessee
And he used to have a
consulting business in Indonesia...
but what is he building in there?
What the hell is building in there?
He has no friends
But he gets a lot of mail
I'll bet he spent a little
Time in jail...
I heard he was up on the
Roof last night
Signaling with a flashlight
And what's that tune he's
What's he building in there?
What's he building in there?
We have a right to know...
You can hang me in a bottle like a cat
Let the crows pick me clean but for my hat
Where the wailing of a baby
Meets the footsteps of the dead
We're all mad here
As the devil sticks his flag into the mud
Mrs Carol has run off with Reverend Judd
Hell is such a lonely place
And your big expensive face will never last
And you'll die with the rose still on your lips
And in time the heartshaped bone that was your hips
And the worms, they will climb the rugged ladder of your spine
We're all mad here
And my eyeballs roll this terrible terrain
And we're all inside a decomposing train
And your eyes will die like fish
And the shore of your face will turn to bone
When you walk through the garden
you gotta watch your back
well I beg your pardon
walk the straight and narrow track
if you walk with Jesus
he's gonna save your soul
you gotta keep the devil
way down in the hole
he's got the fire and the fury
at his command
well you don't have to worry
if you hold on to Jesus hand
we'll all be safe from Satan
when the thunder rolls
just gotta help me keep the devil
way down in the hole
All the angels sing about Jesus' mighty sword
and they'll shield you with their wings
and keep you close to the lord
don't pay heed to temptation
for his hands are so cold
you gotta help me keep the devil
way down in the hole
Last night I dreamed that I was dreaming of you
And from a window across the lawn I watched you undress
Wearing your sunset of purple tightly woven around your hair
That rose in strangled ebony curls
Moving in a yellow bedroom light
The air is wet with sound
The faraway yelping of a wounded dog
And the ground is drinking a slow faucet leak
Your house is so soft and fading as it soaks the black summer heat
A light goes on and the door opens
And a yellow cat runs out on the stream of hall light and into the yard
A wooden cherry scent is faintly breathing the air
I hear your champagne laugh
You wear two lavender orchids
One in your hair and one on your hip
A string of yellow carnival lights comes on with the dusk
Circling the lake with a slowly dipping halo
And I hear a banjo tango
And you dance into the shadow of a black poplar tree
And I watched you as you disappeared
I watched you as you disappeared
I watched you as you disappeared
I watched you as you disappeared
Warm beer and cold women, I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumbled into tonight
That's just how it's been
All these double knit strangers with
Gin and vermouth and recycled stories
In the naugahyde booths
With the platinum blondes
And tobacco brunettes
I'll be drinkin? to forget you
Lite another cigarette
And the band's playin? something
By tammy wynette
And the drinks are on me tonight
All my conversations I'll just be
Talkin? about you baby
Borin? some sailor as I try to get through
I just want him to listen
That's all you have to do
He said I'm better off without you
Till I showed him my tattoo
Now the moon's rising
Ain't got no time to lose
Time to get down to drinking
Tell the band to play the blues
Drink's are on me, I'll buy another round
At the last ditch attempt saloon
Warm beer and cold women, I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumbled into tonight
That's just how it's been
All these double knit strangers with
Gin and vermouth and recycled stories
In the naugahyde booths
With the platinum blondes
And tobacco brunettes
I'll be drinking to forget you
Lite menthol cigarette
And the band's playing somethin?
By johnnie barnett
And the drinks are on me tonight
He's got himself a homemade special
You know his glass is full of sand
And it feels just like a jaybird
The way it fits into his hand
He rolled a blade up in his trick towel
They slap their hands against the wall
You never trip, you never stumble
He's walking spanish down the hall
Slim him a picture of our Jesus
Or give him a spoon to dig a hole
What all he done ain't no one's business
But he'll need blankets for the cold
They dim the lights over on Broadway
Even the king has bowed his head
Every face looks right up at Mason
He's walking spanish down the hall
Latella's screeching for a blind pig
Punk Sander's carved it out of wood
He never sang when he got hoodwinked
They tried it all but he never would
Tomorrow morning there'll be laundry
But he'll be somewhere else to hear the call
Don't say goodbye he's just leaving early
He's walking spanish down the hall
All St. Barthelemew said was whispered
Into the ear of Blind Jack Dawes
All Baker told the machine
Was that he never broke the law
Go on and tip your hat up to the Pilate
Take off your watch, your rings and all
Even Jesus wanted just a little more time
He's walking spanish down the hall
Well, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue
Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to.
Harold's club is closing, and everybody's going on home
What's a poor boy to do?
I'll just get on back into my short, make it back to the fort
Sleep off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain.
There's got to be some place that's better than this
This life I'm leading's driving me insane
And let me tell you I'm dreaming...
Let me tell you that I'm dreaming to the twilight, this town has got me down.
I've seen all the highlights, I've been walking all around
I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus, carry me away from here
Tell me, what have I got to lose?
'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue
The bars are all closing, 'cause it's quarter to two
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key
Those I leave behind are catching up on me,
Let me tell you they're catching up on me, they're catching up on me
Catching up on me, catching up on me, catching up on me.
Well time is always money
For the boys at Union Square
You can bust your ass till doomsday
But don't forget to say your prayers
Someone's got a wad on the backstreet.
Sacco got a bran' new slack
And your baby is handcuffed on the front seat
You just sit right there, boy and relax
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
Well they spill out of the Cinema 14
To that drag bar there on the block
Best live show by far in the whole east coast
With a bank rolled up in your sock
She stand right there for your pleasure
Half Puerto Rican Chinese
Your got to find your baby somebody to measure
I'm goin' to get me some of these baby.
Four in the mornin' on a Sunday
Sacco drinkin' whiskey in church
Half pint festival brandy
That 'bout to fall right off his perch
The guy in the sweaters off duty
Out in front on the welfare hotel
The guy in the dress is a beauty
Go all the way and I swear you never can tell
Rattle Big Black Bones
in the Danger zone
there's a rumblin' groan
there's a big dark town
it's a place I've found
there's a world going on
they're alive, they're awake
while the rest of the world is asleep
below the mine shaft roads
it will all unfold
there's a world going on
all the roots hang down
swing from town to town
they are marching around
down under your boots
all the trucks unload
beyond the gopher holes
there's a world going on
Well I pulled on trouble's braids
and I hid in the briars
out by the quick mud
stayin' away from the main roads
passin' out wolf tickets
downwind from the blood hounds
and I pulled on trouble's braids
and I lay by a cypress
as quiet as a stone
'til the bleeding stopped
I blew the weather vane
off some old road house
I build a fire in the
skeleton back seat of an old Tucker
and I pulled on trouble's braids
I spanked cold red mud
where the hornet stung deep
and I tossed in the ditch
in a restless sleep
and I pulled on trouble's braids
I hung my rainsoaked jacket
on some old barbed wire
poured cold rusty water
on a miserable fire
I pulled on trouble's braids
the creek was swollen by daybreak and I could just
and I floated downstream
on an old dead tree
and I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
Long way going to
Get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday
I found it in the street
At first I did not see
Lying at my feet
A trampled rose
Passing the hat in church
It never stops going around
You never pay just once
To get the job done
What I done to me,
I done to you
What happened to the trampled rose?
In the muddy street
With the fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup I asked
Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine'
I know that rose,
Like I know my name
The one I gave my love,
It was the same
Now I find it in the street,
A trampled rose
Well I broke down in E. St. Louis
On the Kansas City line
and I drunk up all my money
that I borrowed every time
and I fell down at the derby
and now the night's black as a crow
It was a train that took me away from here
but a train can't bring me home
What made my dreams so hollow
was standing at the depot
with a steeple full of swallows
that could never ring the bell
and I come ten thousand miles away
with not one thing to show
well it was a train that took me away from here
but a train can't bring me home
I remember when I left
without bothering to pack
you know I up and left with
just the clothes I had on my back
now I'm sorry for what I've done
and I'm out here on my own
well it was a train that took me away from
here but a train can't bring me home
Well it's hotter 'n blazes and all the long faces
there'll be no oasis for a dry local grazier
there'll be no refreshment for a thirsty jackaroo
from Melbourne to Adelaide on the overlander
with newfangled buffet cars and faster locomotives
the train stopped in Serviceton less and less often
There's nothing sadder than a town with no cheer
Voc Rail decided the canteen was no longer necessary there
no spirits, no bilgewater and 80 dry locals
and the high noon sun beats a hundred and four
there's a hummingbird trapped in a closed down shoe store
This tiny Victorian rhubarb
kept the watering hole open for sixty five years
now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21 st
wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse
the train smokes down the xylophone
there'll be no stopping here
all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer
no Bourbon, no Branchwater
though the townspeople here
fought her Vic Rail decree tooth and nail
now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21 st
wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse
the train smokes down the xylophone
there'll be no stopping here
all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer
New corn yellow and slaughterhouse red
The birds keep singing
Baby after you're dead
I'm gonna miss you plenty
Big old world
With our abalone
And your mother of pearl
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
I need your moon to be the sky
Don't get your trouser button
Stuck on the fence
Diego red and bedlam money are fine
Why don't you come up here
And see me sometime
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
There's very little leeway
I seen a mattress on the freeway
The moon rises over Dog Street
Jefferson said every things reet
Have all the lights burned
Out on heaven again
I'll never roll the number 7 again
I'm made of bread and I'm on an
Ocean of win
I hear all the birdies
On the phone just fine
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
Black joke and the bean soup
Big sky and the Ford Coupe
Old maid and the dry bones
Red Rover and the Skinny Bones Jones
47 mules to pull this train
We're getting married
In the pouring rain
You need your differential and
Plenty of oil
You load the wagon till
The end of the world
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
What's your throttle made of
IS it money or bone
Don't doddle or you'll
Never get home
Opium, fireworks, vodka and meat
Scoot over and save me a seat
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
If I had it all to do all
I'd try to rise above the law of man
Why don'cha gimme nother
Sip of your cup
Turn a Rolls Royce into a
Chicken coup, uh huh
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did, I've got what I paid for now
See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open,
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger
In your silhouette window light go
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the onearmed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinamen, and the coldblooded signs,
And the girls down by the striptease shows, go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,
And the old men in wheelchairs know
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on an
Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers
And goodnight to Mathilda, too
Well, the smart money's on Harlow
And the moon is in the street
The shadow boys are breaking all the laws
And you're east of East St. Louis
And the wind is making speeches
And the rain sounds like a round of applause
Napoleon is weeping in the Carnival saloon
His invisible fianc is in the mirror
The band is going home
It's raining hammers, it's raining nails
Yes, it's true, there's nothing left for him down here
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
That you love
And it's Time Time Time
And they all pretend they're Orphans
And their memory's like a train
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
And the things you can't remember
Tell the things you can't forget that
History puts a saint in every dream
Well she said she'd steak around
Until the bandages came off
But these mamas boys just don't know when to quit
And Matida asks the sailors are those dreams
Or are those prayers
So just close your eyes, son
And this won't hurt a bit
Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
The boys just dive right off the cars
And splash into the street
And when she's on a roll she pulls a razor
From her boot and a thousand
Pigeons fall around her feet
So put a candle in the window
And a kiss upon his lips
Till the dish outside the window fills with rain
Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
And play the fiddler off till i come back again
As you go out it's Independence Day
But instead I'll just pour myself a drink.
It's got to be love, I've never felt this way.
Oh baby, this one's from the heart
The shadows in the road look like a railroad track.
I wonder if he's ever really comin' back.
The moon's a yellow stain across the sky.
Oh baby, this one's from the heart
Maybe And I'll go down to the corner and get a racin' form,
But And I should prob'ly wait here by the phone.
And the brakes need adjustment on the convertible
Oh baby, this one's from the heart
The worm is climbin' the other color tree
Robin is back against the wall
Pour myself a double sympathy
Oh baby, this one's from the heart.
Blondes, brunettes, and redheads put their hammer down
To put  don't pound a cold chisel thru my heart.
But they were nothin' but apostrophes.
O baby, this one's from the heart.
I can't tell, is that a siren or a saxophone?
But the roads get so slipp'ry when it rains
I love you more than all these words can ever say
Oh baby, this one's from the heart.
Down thru the ages
All the sages
said don't spend your wages on Love
Graft and collusion
 the intrusion
and proceeding foreclosures
down at the crossroads
the question is posed
bridge is washed out
and the highway's closed
   reason
love was designed
to exploit and deceive
There's a 
Wherever you send 'em
Every ball   in your chest
You will see
keeps with tradition
Don't spend your wages on Love
Taking any burgh any city or town
Just get on main street and
drive all the way down
You see love has a graveyard
   
    
and paid thru the nose
your shovel's a shot glass
dig your own hole
bury what's left of your miserable soul
Down thru the ages
All the sages
said don't spend your wages on Love
Graft and collusion
 the intrusion
and proceeding foreclosures
down at the crossroads
the question is posed
bridge is washed out
and the highway's closed
The piano has been drinking
my necktie is asleep
and the combo went back to New York
the jukebox has to take a leak
and the carpet needs a haircut
and the spotlight looks like a prison break
cause the telephone's out of cigarettes
and the balcony's on the make
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking...
and the menus are all freezing
and the lightman's blind in one eye
and he can't see out of the other
and the pianotuner's got a hearing aid
and he showed up with his mother
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
cause the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler
cream puff casper milk toast
and the owner is a mental midget
with the I.Q. of a fencepost
cause the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking...
and you can't find your waitress
with a Geiger counter
And she hates you and your friends
and you just can't get served
and the boxoffice is drooling
and the bar stools are on fire
and the newspapers were fooling
and the ashtrays have retired
the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
The piano has been drinking
not me, not me, not me, not me, not me
You dance real slow
You wreck it down
You walk away, then you
What did that old blonde
That is the part...
You throw away
I want that beggars eyes
A winning horse
A tidy Mexican divorce
St. Mary's prayers
And a Barman who always
Will you loose the flowers
Hold on to the vase
Will you wipe all those teardrops
Away from your fase
I can't help thinking
As I close the door
I have done all of this
Many times before
The bone must go
The wish can stay
The kiss don't know
What the lips will say
Forget I've hurt you
Put stones in your bed
And remember to never
Well all of your letters
Burned up in the fire
Time is just memory
Mixed in with Desire
That's not the road it is
Only the map...I say
Gone just like matches
From a closed down cabaret
In a Portuguese Saloon
A fly is a circling around
You'll soon forget the
Tune that you play
For that is the part
You throw away
Ah, that is the part
You throw away
Well this gigolo's jumping salty, ain't no trade out on the streets,
Half past the unlucky, and the hawk's a frontrow seat
Dressed in full orchestration, stagedoor Johnny's got to pay,
And sent him home talking 'bout the one that got away
Could have been on Easy Street, could have been a wheel,
With irons in the fire and all them business deals
But the last of the bigtime losers shouted before he drove away,
"I'll be right back, as soon as I crack the one that got away"
Well, the ambulance drivers, they don't give a shit,
They just want to get off work, and
The short stop and the victim are already gone berserk
And the shroudtailor measures him for a deepsix holiday,
The stiff is froze, the case is closed on the one that got away
Now Jim Crow's directing traffic with them cemetery blues,
With them peculiarlooking trousers, them old Italian shoes
And a wooden kimono that was all ready to drop in San Francisco Bay
But he's mumbling something all about the one that got away
And Costello was the champion at the St. Moritz Hotel,
And the best this side of Fairfax, reliable sources tell
But his reputation is at large, and he's at Ben Frank's every day,
Waiting for the one that got away
He got a snakeskin sportshirt, and he looks like Vincent Price,
With a little piece of chicken, and he's carving off a slice
Someone tipped her off, and she'll be doing a Houdini now any day
She shook his hustle, and a Greyhound bus'll take the one that got away
Well, Andre's at the piano behind the Ivar in the sewers,
With a buck a shot for pop tunes, and a fin for guided tours
He coulda been in "Casa Blanca", he stood in line out there all day
Now he's spilling whiskey and learning songs about a one that got away
Well I've lost my equilibrium and my car keys and my pride,
The tattoo parlor's warm, and so I hustle there inside
And the grinding off the buzzsaw, "What you want that thing to say?"
I says, "Just don't misspell her name, buddy, she's the one that got away"
The ocean doesn't want me today
But I'll be back tomorrow to play
And the stranglers will take me
Down deep in their brine
The mischievous braingels
Down into the endless blue wine
I'll open my head and let out
All of my time
I'd love to go drowning
And to stay and to stay
But the ocean doesn't want me today
I'll go in up to here
It can't possibly hurt
All they will find is my beer
And my shirt
A rip tide is raging
And the life guard is away
But the ocean doesn't want me today
The ocean doesn't want me today
Well I stumbled in the darkness
I'm lost and alone
Though I said I'd go before us
And show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead
I can't hold on very long
Forgive me pretty baby but I always take the long way home
Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train
Got a handful of lightening
A hat full of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
And I love you pretty baby but I always take the long way home
I put food on the table
And a roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For The highway instead
Watch your back if I should tell you
That loves the only thing I've ever known
One thing for sure pretty baby I always take the long way home
You know I love you baby
More than the whole wide world
You are my woman
I know you are my pearl
Let's go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me and we can take the long way home
Come with me, together we can take the long way home
Come with me, together we can take the long way home
I love the way
The tattered clouds
Go wind across the sky
As summer goes
And leave me
With a tear in my eye
I'm taking out my winter clothes
My garden knows what's wrong
The petals of my favorite rose
Be in the shadows dark and long
Through every year
It's very clear
I should be used
To carrying on
But I can't be found
IN the garden
Singing this song
When the last
Rose of summer is gone
A cab combs the snake,
Tryin' to rake in that last night's fare,
And a solitary sailor
Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers...
Paws his inside Pcoat pocket for a welcome twentyfive cents,
And the last bent butt from a package of Kents,
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair.
Her rhinestonestudded moniker says, "Irene"
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes
And the Texaco beacon burns on,
The steelbelted attendant with a 'Ring and Valve Special'...
Cryin' "Fill'er up and check that oil"
"You know it could be a distributor and it could be a coil."
The early mornin' final edition's on the stands,
And that town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands.
Pigs in a blanket sixtynine cents,
Eggs  roll 'em over and a package of Kents,
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em damn straight,
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late.
And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamond
Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe Devilles,
Leaving the town in akeeping
Of the one who is sweeping
Up the ghost of Saturday night...
Now you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin? down the boulevard
You're lookin? for the Heart of Saturday Night
An? you got paid on Friday
Your pockets a'jinglin?
Then you see the lights
An? you get all tinglin?
Cuz you're cruisin? with a six
An? you're lookin? for the Heart of Saturday Night
Then you comb your hair
You shave your face
Tryin? to wipe out every trace
Of all the other days
In the week
You know that this will be the Saturday
You're reachin? your peak
Stoppin? on the red
Goin' on the green
Cuz tonight will be like nothin? you've ever seen
An? you're barrelin? down the boulevard
An? you're lookin? for the Heart of Saturday Night
An? tell me is it the crack of the pool balls
Telephone's ringin? it's your second cousin
An? is it the barmaid that's smilin?
In the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
Makes it kind a quiver
Down in the core
Cuz? your dreamin? of them Saturdays that came before
An? now you're stumblin?
You're stumblin? onto the Heart of Saturday Night
An? you gassed her up
An? you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin? down the boulevard
You're lookin? for the Heart of Saturday night
Is it the crack of the pool balls
Telephone's ringin? it's your second cousin
An? the barmaid that's smilin?
In the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
Makes it kind a special
Down in the core
An? your dreamin? of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin?
Stumblin? onto the Heart of Saturday Night
An? you're stumblin?
Stumblin? onto the Heart of Saturday Night
I fell asleep down by the stream
And there I had the strangest dream
And down by brennan's glenn there grows
A briar and a rose
There's a tree in the forest
But I don't know where
I built a nest out of your hair
And climbing up into the air
A briar and a rose
I don't know how long it has been
But I was born in brennan's glenn
And near the end of spring there grows
A briar and a rose
P icked the rose one early morn
I pricked my finger on a thorn
It had grown so high
It's winding wove the briar around the rose
I tried to tear them both apart
I felt a bullet in my heart
And all dressed up in springs and clothes
The briar and the rose
And when I'm buried in my grave
Tell me so I will know
Your tears will fall
To make love grow
The briar and the rose
Come on a long with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lay down in the web of the black spider
I'll drink your blood like wine
So come on in
It ain't no sin
Take off your skin
And dance around your bones
So come along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Anchors away with the Black Rider
I'll drink your blood like wine
I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider
Out where the bullets shine
And when you're done
You cock your gun
The blood will run
Like ribbons in your hair
So come along wit hthe Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Come on along with the Black Rider
I've got just the thing for thee
Come on along with the Black Rider
I want your company
I'll have the veal
A lovely meal
That's how I feel
May I use your skull for a bowl
Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
That's the way the stomach rumbles
That's the way the bee bumbles
That's the way the needle pricks
That's the way the glue sticks
That's the way the potato mashes
That's the way the pan flashes
That's the way the market crashes
That's the way the whip lashes
That's the way the teeth knashes
That's the way the gravy stains
That's the way the moon wanes
Well there's one thing you can't lose
It's that feel
Your pants, your shirt, your shoes
But not that feel
You can throw it out in the rain
You can whip it like a dog
You can chop it down like an old dead tree
You can always see it
When you're coming into town
Once you hang it on the wall
You can never take it down
But there's one thing you can't lose
ANd it's that feel
You can pawn your watch and chain
But not that feel
It always comes and finds you
It will always hear yo ucry
I cross my wooden leg
And I swear on my glass eye
Itt will never leave you high and dry
Never leave you loose
It's harder to get rid of than tattoos
But there's one thing you can't do
Is lose that feel
You can throw it off a bridge
You can lose it in the fire
Yo ucan leave it at the altar
But it will make you out a liar
You can fall down in the street
You can leaveit in the lurch
Well you say that it's gospel
But I know that it's only church
And there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
It's that feel
Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
everything is made from dreams
time is made from honey slow and sweet
only the fools know what it means
temptation, temptation, temptation
oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist
I know that she is made of smoke
but I've lost my wayy
she knows that I am broke
so that I must play
temptation, temptation, temptation
oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist
Dutch pink and Italian blue
she is waiting there for you
my will has disappeared
now my confusions oh so clear
temptation, temptation, temptation
whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation
I can't reisist
All night long on the broken glass
livin in a medicine chest
mediteromanian hotel back
sprawled across a roll top desk
the monkey rode the blade on an
they paint the donkey blue if you pay
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
my baby's coming home today
will you sell me one of those if I shave my head
get me out of town is what fireball said
never trust a man in a blue trench coat
never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival
Friday's a gem
dye your hair yellow
and raise your hem
follow me to beulah's on
dry creek road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed
take me down to buy a tux
on red rose bear
got to cut a hole in the day
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
my baby's coming home today
Well you play that tarantella all the hounds will start to roar
The boys all go to hell and then the Cubans hit the floor
They drive along the pipeline, they tango 'til they're sore
They take apart their nightmares and they leave them by the door
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
And send me off to bed for evermore
Make sure they play my theme song, I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed 'til I get back in town
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
So send me off to bed for evermore
Just make sure she's all in calico and the color of a doll
Wave the flag on Cadillac day, and a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold your breath 'til the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood, send me off to another town, and just
And just let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
Tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Will you send me off to bed for evermore
Fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Send me off to bed for evermore, send me off to bed for evermore
take me home
you silly boy
put your arms around me
take me home
you silly boy
all the world's not round without you
I'm so sorry that I broke your heart
please don't leave my side
take me home
you silly boy
cause I'm still in love you
Phone's off the hook
No one knows where we are
It's a long time since I
The ocean is blue
As blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Old long since gone
Now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
Ain't no good thing
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Far far away a train
Wherever you're goin
Wherever you've been
Waving good bye at the end
Of the day
You're up and you're over
And you're far away
Always for you, and
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
All broken down by
The side of the road
I was never more alive or
I've worn the faces off
All the cards
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Children are playing
At the end of the day
Strangers are singing
On our lawn
It's got to be more
Than flesh and bone
All that you're loved
Is all you own
In a land there's a town
And in that town there's
And in that house
There's a woman
And in that woman
There's a hart I love
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go
I knew one day
One, one, two, one, two, three
Well my mama didn’t want me
On the day I was born
I was born without a body
I got nothing but scorn
But I always loved music
All I had was my hands
I dreamed I'd be famous
And I’d work at The Sands
Singing, Tabletop Joe, Tabletop Joe
Now everyone will know
That I'm Tabletop Joe
I had trouble with the pedals
But I had a strong left hand
And I could play Stravinsky
On a baby grand
I said, ‘I’m gonna join the circus
Cause that’s where I belong’
So I went to Coney Island
I was singing this song
Tabletop Joe, Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows
Yeah I'm Tabletop Joe
They gave me top billing
In the Dreamland show
I had my own orchestra
Starring Tabletop Joe
And the man without a body
Proved everyone wrong
I was rich and I was famous
I was where I belonged, yeah
Tabletop Joe, Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows, yeah
Take it home boy
Walter DonaldsonEdgar Leslie
When you hear sweet syncopation
And the music softly moans
T'ain't no sin to take off your skin
And dance around in your bones
When it gets too hot for comfot
And you can't get an ice cream cone
T'ain't no sin to take off your skin
And dance around your bones
Just like those bamboo babies
Down in the South Sea tropic zone
T'ain't no sin to take off your skin
And dance around your bones
Well he came home from the war
with a party in his head
and modified Brougham DeVille
and a pair of legs that opened up
like butterfly wings
and a mad dog that wouldn't
he went and took up with a Salvation Army
who played dirty water
on a swordfishtrombone
he went to sleep at the bottom of
and he said "gee, but it's
great to be home."
Well he came home from the war
with a party in his head
and an idea for a fireworks display
and he knew that he'd be ready with
a stainless steel machete
and a half a pint of Ballentine's
and he holed up in room above a hardware store
cryin' nothing there but Hollywood tears
and he put a spell on some
poor little Crutchfield girl
and stayed like that for 27 years
Well he packed up all his
expectations he lit out for California
with a flyswatter banjo on his knee
with a lucky tiger in his angel hair
and benzedrine for getting there
they found him in a eucalyptus tree
lieutenant got him a canary bird
and shaked her head with every word
and Chesterfielded moonbeams in a song
and he got 20 years for lovin' her
from some Oklahoma governor
said everything this Doughboy
does is wrong
Now some say he's doing
the obituary mambo
and some say he's hanging on the wall
perhaps this yarn's the only thing
that holds this man together
some say he was never here at all
Some say they saw him down in
Birmingham, sleeping in a
boxcar going by
and if you think that you can tell a bigger tale
I swear to God you'd have to tell a lie...
Well pale face said
To the eyeball Kid
She just goes clank and boom and steam
A halo, wings, horns and a tail
Shoveling coal inside my dreams
There are no laws
She's made of cream
She's such a scream
Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement
A Donnie gal from mortal clay
The plow is red
The well is full inside
The dollhouse of her skull
A cheetah coat fills up with steam
She's such a scream
All crooked lines
A milktrain so clean
Machine gun haste
You'll ride the only wall of shame
And drag that chain across the state
Her lips are red
She is the queen
She's such a scream
Tom Waits for Marianne Faithful
Will you take me across the Channel,
London Bridge is falling down.
Strange a woman tries to save
What a man will try to drown.
And he's the rain that they predicted,
Its the forecast every time.
The rose has died because you picked it
And I believe that brandy's mine.
And all over the world
Talk only about the weather.
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same.
The world is getting flatter,
The sky is falling all around.
And nothing is the matter
For I never cry in town.
And a love like ours, my dear,
Is best measured when its down.
And I never buy umbrellas,
For there's always one around.
And all over the world Strangers Talk only about the weather. All over the world It's the same
It's the same
It's the same.
And you know that its beginning,
And you know that its the end
When once again we are strangers
And the fog comes rolling in.
And all over the world
Talk only about the weather.
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same.

Life is whittled
Life's a riddle
Man's a fiddle that life plays on
When the day breaks, and the earth quakes
Life's a mistake all day long
Tell me, who gives a good gooddamn
You'll never get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In a crooked ol' world
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly of a whale
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly of a whale
Dan't take my word
Just look skyward
They that dance must pay the fiddler
Sky is darkening
Dogs are barking
But the caravan moves on
Tell me who gives a good gooddamn
You'll never get get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In crooked ol' world
Starving in the Belly...
As the crow flies
It's there the truth lies
At the bottom of the well
Eoleven goes to heaven
Bless the dead here as the rain falls
Don't trust a bull's horn
A doberman's tooth
A runaway horse or me
Don't be greedy, don't be needy
If you live in hope you're
Dancing to a terrible tune
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly...
Tom Waits and Chuck E. Weiss
well the damn cracked hard just like a bull whip
cause it wasn't takin' no lip from the night before
as it shook out the street, the stew bums showed up
just like bounced checks, rubbin' their necks
and the sky turned the color of PeptoBismol
and the parking lots growled
and my old sports coat full of promissory notes
and a receipt from a late night motel
and the hawk had his whole family out
there in the wind, and he's got a message
for you to beware cause he be kickin' your
ass in, in a cold blooded fashion
dishin' out more than a good man can bear
I got shoes untied, shirt tail's out, ain't got a
ghost of a chance with this old romance
just an apartment for rent down the block
Ivar Theater with live burlesque
and the manager's scowlin', feet on his desk
boom boom against the curtain
you're still hurtin'
and then push came to shove, shove came to biff
girls like that just lay you out stiff
maybe I'll go to Cleveland or
get me a tattoo or somethin', my brother
in law's there
skid mark tattoo on the asphalt blue
was that a Malibu
Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift
cumming on to the broads with the
same ol' riff. Hey baby come up to
my place, we'll listen to some
smooth music on the stereo, no thank you
got any Stan Getz records
no I got Smothers Brothers
so I combed back my Detroit
jack up my pegs, wiped my Stacy Adams
jacknifed my legs, yea I got designs
on a moving violation
hey baby, you put me on hold and I'm
out in the wind and it's getting
colder than a gut shot bitch wolf dog
with 9 sucking pups pullin' a 4 trap
up a hill in the dead of winter
in the middle of a snowstorm
with a mouth full of porcupine quills
yea well I don't need you baby
It's a well known fact
I'm 4 sheets to the wind
I'm glad you're gone
I'm glad you're gone
I'm finally alone
glad you're gone, but I
wish you'd come home
and I struggled out of bed
cause the dawn was crackin' hard like a bullwhip
cause it wasn't takin' no lip from the night before
as it shook out the streets the stew bums
showed up just like bounced checks
rubbin' their necks, and the sky turned the
color of PeptoBismol
and my old sports coat full of promissory notes
and the hawk had his whole family out there
in the wind, he got a message for you to beware
kickin' your ass in, in a cold blooded fashion
he be dishin' out more than a good man can bear
well hey baby let's take it to Bakersfield
get a little apartment somewhere
well the dawn cracked hard just like a bull whip
cause it wasn't takin' no lip from the night before
as it shook out the street, the stew bums showed up
just like bounced checks, rubbin' their necks
and the sky turned the color of PeptoBismol
and the parking lots growled
and my old sports coat full of promissory notes
and a receipt from a late night motel
and the hawk had his whole family out

dishin' out more than a good man can bear
I got shoes untied, shirt tail's out, ain't got a
ghost of a chance with this old romance
just an apartment for rent down the block
Ivar Theater with live burlesque
and the manager's scowlin', feet on his desk
boom boom against the curtain
you're still hurtin'
and then push came to shove, shove came to biff
girls like that just lay you out stiff
maybe I'll go to Cleveland or
get me a tattoo or somethin', my brother
in law's there
skid mark tattoo on the asphalt blue
was that a Malibu
Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift
cumming on to the broads with the
same ol' riff. Hey baby come up to
my place, we'll listen to some
smooth music on the stereo, no thank you
got any Stan Getz records
no I got Smothers Brothers
so I combed back my Detroit
jack up my pegs, wiped my Stacy Adams
jacknifed my legs, yea I got designs
on a moving violation
hey baby, you put me on hold and I'm
out in the wind and it's getting
colder than a gut shot bitch wolf dog
with 9 sucking pups pullin' a 4 trap
up a hill in the dead of winter
in the middle of a snowstorm
with a mouth full of porcupine quills
scat yea well I don't need you baby
It's a well known fact
I'm 4 sheets to the wind
I'm glad you're gone
I'm glad you're gone
I'm finally alone
glad you're gone, but I
wish you'd come home
and I struggled out of bed
cause the dawn was crackin' hard like a bullwhip
cause it wasn't takin' no lip from the night before
as it shook out the streets the stew bums
showed up just like bounced checks
rubbin' their necks, and the sky turned the
color of PeptoBismol
and my old sports coat full of promissory notes
and the hawk had his whole family out there
in the wind, he got a message for you to beware
kickin' your ass in, in a cold blooded fashion
he be dishin' out more than a good man can bear
well hey baby let's take it to Bakersfield
get a little apartment somewhere
Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn
Time to care

A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand
And I'll take you there

Davenports and kettle drums
and swallow tail coats
table cloths and patent leather shoes
bathing suits and bowling balls
and clarinets and rings
and all this radio really
needs is a fuse
a tinker, a tailor
a soldier's things
his rifle, his boots full of rocks
and this one is for bravery
and this one is for me
and everything's a dollar
in this box
Cuff links and hub caps
trophies and paperbacks
it's good transportation
but the brakes aren't so hot
neck tie and boxing gloves
this jackknife is rusted
you can pound that dent out
on the hood
a tinker, a tailor
a soldier's things
his rifle, his boots full of rocks
oh and this one is for bravery
and this one is for me
and everything's a dollar
in this box
Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight,
And nobody flinched down by the arcade
And the marquees weren't weeping, they went starkraving mad,
And the cabbies were the only ones that really had it made
And his cold trousers were twisted, and the sirens high and shrill,
And crumpled in his fist was a fivedollar bill
And the naked mannequins with their Cheshire grins,
And the raconteurs and roustabouts said "Buddy, come on in, 'cause
'Cause the dreams ain't broken down here now, they're walking with a limp
Now that Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight"
And nobody flinched down by the arcade
And the burglar alarm's been disconnected,
And the newsmen start to rattle
And the cops are telling jokes about some whorehouse in Seattle
And the fire hydrants plead the Fifth Amendment
And the furniture is bargains galore
But the blood is by the jukebox on an old linoleum floor
And what a hot rain on FortySecond Street,
And now the umbrellas ain't got a chance
And the newsboy's a lunatic with stains on his pants, 'cause
'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight
And no one's gone over to close his eyes
And there's a racing form in his pocket,
Circled "Blue Boots" in the third
And the cashier at the clothing store didn't say a word
As the siren tears the night in half, and someone lost his wallet
Well, a surveillance of assailance, it that's what you want to call it
And the whores hike up their skirts and fish for drugstore prophylactics
With their mouths cut just like razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos
And her radiator's steaming and her teeth are in a wreck, and nah,
She won't let you kiss her, but what the hell do you expect?
And the Gypsies are tragic and if you want to buy perfume,
Well, they'll bark you down like carneys, sell you Christmas cards in June, but
But Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight
And his headstone's a gumball machine,
No more chewing gum or baseball cards or overcoats or dreams
Someone's hosing down the sidewalk, and he's only in his teens, 'cause
'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight
And a fistful of dollars can't change that,
And someone copped his watch fob, and someone got his ring
And the newsboy got his porkpie Stetson hat
And the tuberculosis old men at the Nelson wheeze and cough
And someone will head south until this whole thing cools off, 'cause
'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight, yeah,
Small Change got rained on with his own thirtyeight
Got Rained on with His Own .38

God said don't give me your
Tin horn prayers
Don't buy roses off the street down there
Took it all and took the dirt road home
Dreaming of Jenny with the light brown hair
Night is falling like a bloody axe
Lies and rumors and the wind at my back
Hand on the wheel gravel on the road
Will the pawn shop sell me back what I sold
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I"m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
Birds cry warning from a hidden branch
Carving out a future with a gun and an axe
I'm way beyond the gavel and the laws of man
Still living in the palm of the grace of your hand
The worlds not easy the blind man said
Turns on nothing but money and dread
Dogs been scratching at the door all nite
Long neck birds flying out of the moon light
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I"m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
Smack dab in the middle of a dirty lie
The star spangled glitter of his one good eye
Everybody knows that the game was rigged
Justice wears suspenders and a powdered wig
Dark town alleys been hiding you
Long bell tolling is your waterloo
Oh baby what can you do
Does the light of god blind you
Or lead the way home for you?
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I"m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
God all mighty for righteousness sake
Humiliation of our fallen state
Written in the book of tubold Cain
A long black over coat will show no stain
Feel the heat and the burn on your back
The rip and the moan and the stretch of the rack
All my belongings in a flour sack
Will the place I come from
Take me back
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I"m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
They'll hang me in the morning on a scaffold yea big
To dance upon nothing to the tyborn jig
Treats you like a puppet when your under its spell
Oh the heart is heaven
But the mind is hell
Jesus of Nazareth told Mike of the weeds
I's born at this time for a reason you see
When I'm dead I"ll be dead a long time
But the wines so pleasing and so sublime
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I"m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
Kissed my sweetheart by the chinaball tree
Everything I done is between God and me
Only he will judge how my time was spent
29 days of sinning and 40 to repent
The horse is steady but the horse is blind
Wicked are the branches on the tree of mankind
The roots grow upwared and the branches grow down
Its much too late to throw the dice again I've found
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I"m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Father
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Mother
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Brother
We sail tonight for Singapore
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for tawny moor
Took off to the land of Nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I danced along a colored wind
Dangled from a rope of sand
You must say goodbye to me
We sail tonight for Singapore
Don't fall asleep while you're ashore
Cross your heart and hope to die
When you hear the children cry.
Let marrow bone and cleaver choose
While making feet for children shoes
Through the alley
Back from Hell
When you hear that steeple bell
You must say goodbye to me.
Wipe him down with gasoline
Till his arms are hard and mean,
From now on boys this iron boat's your home
So heave away boys.
We sail tonight for Singapore
Take your blankets from the floor
Wash your mouth out by the door
The whole town is made of iron ore
Every witness turns to steam
They all become Italian dreams
Fill your pockets up with earth
Get yourself a dollar's worth
Away boys, away, boys, heave away
The captain is a onearmed dwarf
He's throwing dice along the wharf
In the land of the blind, the oneeyed man is King
So take this ring
Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart
I rolled down the national stroll
and with a big fat paycheck
strapped to my hip sack
and a shore leave wristwatch underneath
in a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels
I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank
and I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga
and was in a bad need of a shave
and so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein
and shot billards with a midget
until the rain stopped
and I bought a long sleeved shirt
with horses on the front
and some gum and a lighter and a knife
and a new deck of cards with girls on the back
and I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife
and I said Baby, I'm so far away from home
and I miss my Baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so
Well I was pacing myself
trying to make it all last
squeezing all the life
out of a lousy two day pass
and I had a cold one at the Dragon
with some Filipino floor show
and talked baseball with a lieutenant
over a Singapore sling
and I wondered how the same moon outside
over this Chinatown fair
could look down on Illinois
and find you there
and you know I love you Baby
and I'm so far away from home
and I miss my Baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so
I'm leavin' my fam'ly
Leavin' all my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
On a new front page sky
My tears are salt water
And the moon's full and high
And I know Martin Eden's
Gonna be proud of me
And many before me
Who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest
Singin' my say
Shiver me Timbers
'Cause I'm asailin' away
And the fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
I'm driftin' on out
Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me, now.
So swallow me, don't follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone
So please call my missus
Gotta tell her not to cry
'Cause my goodbye is written
By the moon in the sky
Hey and nobody knows me
I can't fathom my stayin'
Shiver me timbers
'Cause I'm asailin' away
And the fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
I'm driftin' on out
Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me
So come and swallow me, follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone
And I'm leavin' my family
Leavin' all my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
Upon a new front page sky
And shiver me timbers
'Cause I'm asailin' away
Strip Poker Motel
Got a small blue tail
Hot ice, cold cash
I never been no good at staying out of jail
Wheel spin, roulette
Who's giving, don't get
Ripped shirt, black eye
Tuxedo, bow tie
Dark sound, straight road
Get lost, get loaded
Enlisted men, off duty
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
Cold gun, wild rose
Night clerk, door closed
Lie down baby
Your love is a faucet
Called China, cell phone
Chun King, not home
You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Shake it, shake it. shake it baby!
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Outside, it's damp
Put a towel on that lamp
You look hot in this light
I can love you all night
Shoes off, hair down
Got a pink night gown
Mike Tyson, KO'ed
On the wild, blue road
Small town, straight road
That rooster, done crowed
Flat tire, homemade cross
You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby!
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it. shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Well you hate those diesels rollin'
And those Friday nights out bowlin'
When he's off for a twelve hour lay over night
You wish you had a dollar
For every time he hollered
That he's leavin'
And he's never comin' back
But the curtainlaced billow
And his hands on your pillow
And his trousers are hangin' on the chair
You're lyin' through your pain, babe
But you're gonna tell him he's your man
And you ain't got the courage to leave
He tells you that you're on his mind
You're the only one he's ever gonna find
It's kinda special, understands his complicated soul...
But the only place a man can breathe
And collect his thoughts is
Midnight and flyin' away on the road.
But you've packed and unpacked
So many times you've lost track
And the steam heat is drippin' off the walls
But when you hear his engines
You're lookin' through the window in the kitchen and you know
You're always gonna be there when he calls
'Cause he's a truck drivin' man
Stoppin' when he can
He's a truck drivin' man
Stoppin' when he can
it's too early for the circus, it's too late for the bars, no one's sleepin'
but the paperboys, and no one in this town is makin' any noise, but the dogs
and the milkmen and me.
the girls around here all look like cadillacs, no one likes a stranger here,
i'd come home but i'm afraid that you won't take me back, but i'd trade off
everything just to have you near.
i know i'm irresponsible and i don't behave, and i ruin everything that i
do, and i'll probably get arrested when i'm in my grave, but i'll be savin'
all my love for you.
i paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute, with too much makeup and a broken
shoe, but her eyes were just a counterfeit, she tried to gyp me out of it, but
you know that i'm still in love you.
don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me, cause i ain't as bad as
they make me out to be, well i may lose my mind but baby can't you see, that
i'll be savin' all my love for you.
I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light
I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody, until I needed a song.
I never saw the white line, 'til I was leaving you behind
I never knew I needed you 'til I was caught up in a bind
I never spoke 'I love you' 'til I cursed you in vain,
I never felt my heartstrings until I nearly went insane.
I never saw the east coast 'til I move to the west
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off your breast
I never saw your heart 'til someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away
I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face.
i will leave behind all of my clothes, i wore when i was with you, all i
need's my railroad boots, and my leather jacket, as i say goodbye to ruby's
arms, although my heart is breaking, i will steal away out through your
blinds, for soon you will be waking.
the morning light has washed your face, and everything is turning blue now,
hold on to your pillow case there's nothing i can do now, as i say goodbye to
ruby's arms, you'll find another soldier, and i swear to god by christmas,
there'll be someone else to hold you.
the only thing i'm taking is the scarf off of your clothesline, i'll hurry
past your chest of drawers, and your broken window chimes, as i say goodbye
i'll say goodbye, say goodbye to ruby's arms.
i'll feel my way down the darken hall, and out into the morning, the hobos
at the freightyards, have kept their fires burning, so jesus christ this
goddamn rain, will someone put me on a train, i'll never kiss your lips again,
or break your heart, as i say goodbye i'll say goodbye, say goodbye to ruby's
Well I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me,
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody.
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...
And the moon's all up, full and big, apricot tips in an indigo sky,
And I've been loving you, Rosie, since the day I was born
And I'll love you, Rosie 'til the day I die.
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...
And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me,
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody.
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie
romeo is bleeding but not so as you'd notice
he's over on 18hh street as usual
lookin' so hard against the hood of his car
and puttin' out a cigarette in his hand
and for all the pachucos at the pumps
at romeros paint and body
they all seein' how far they can spit
well it was just another night
but how they're huddled in the brake lights of a 58 belair
and listenin' to how romeo killed a sherrif his knife
and they all jump when they hear the sirens
but romeo just laughs and says
all the racket in the world ain't never gonna
save that coppers ass
he'll never see another summertime for gunnin' down my brother
and leavin' him like a dog beneath a car without his knife
and romeo says hey man gimme a cigarette
and they all reach for their pack
and frankie lights it for him and pats him on the back
and throws bottle at a milk truck
and as it breaks he grabs his nuts
and they all know they could be just like romeo
if they only had the guts
but romeo is bleeding but nobody can tell
and he sings along with the radio
with a bullet in his chest
and he combs back his fenders
and they all agree its clear
that every thing is cool now that romeos here
but romeo is bleeding
and he winces now and then and he leans against
the car doors and feels the blood in his shoes
and someones crying in the phone booth
at the 5 points by thestore
romeo starts his engine
and wipes the blood off the door
and he brodys through the signal
with the radio full blast
leavin' the boys there hikin' up there chinos
and they all try to stand like romeo
beneath the moon cut like a sickle
and they're talkin' now in spanish about there hero
but romeo is bleeding as he gives the man his ticket
and he climbs to the balcony at the movies
and he'll die without a wimper
like every heros dream
just an angel with a bullet
and cagney on the screen
Young Abdel Mahdi Shahmay was only 18 years old,
He was the youngest of nine children, never spent a night away from home.
And his mother held his photograph, opening the New York Times
To see the killing has intensified along the road to peace
There was a tall, thin boy with a whispy moustache disguised as an orthodox Jew
On a crowded bus in Jerusalem, some had survived World War Two
And the thunderous explosion blew out windows 200 yards away
With more retribution and seventeen dead along the road to peace
Now at King George Ave and Jaffa Road passengers boarded bus 14a
In the aisle next to the driver Abdel Mahdi Shahmay
And the last thing that he said on earth is "God is great and God is good"
And he blew them all to kingdom come upon the road to peace
Now in response to this another kiss of death was visited upon
Yasser Taha, Israel says is an Hamas senior militant
And Israel sent four choppers in, flames engulfed, tears wide open
And it killed his wife and his three year old child leaving only blackened skeletons
It's found his toddlers bottle and a pair of small shoes and they waved them in front of the cameras
But Israel says they did not know that his wife and child were in the car
There are roadblocks everywhere and only suffering on TV
Neither side will ever give up their smallest right along the road to peace
Israel launched it's latest campaign against Hamas on Tuesday
Two days later Hamas shot back and killed five Israeli soldiers
So thousands dead and wounded on both sides most of them middle eastern civilians
They fill the children full of hate to fight an old man's war and die upon the road to peace
"And this is our land we will fight with all our force" say the Palastinians and the Jews
Each side will cut off the hand of anyone who tries to stop the resistance
If the right eye offends thee then you must pluck it out
And Mahmoud Abbas said Sharon had been lost out along the road to peace
Once Kissinger said "we have no friends, America only has interests"
Now our president wants to be seen as a hero and he's hungry for reelection
But Bush is reluctant to risk his future in the fear of his political failures
So he plays chess at his desk and poses for the press 10,000 miles from the road to peace
In the video that they found at the home of Abdel Mahdi Shahmay
He held a Kalashnikov rifle and he spoke with a voice like a boy
He was an excellent student, he studied so hard, it was as if he had a future
He told his mother that he had a test that day out along the road to peace
The fundamentalist killing on both sides is standing in the path of peace
But tell me why are we arming the Israeli army with guns and tanks and bullets?
And if God is great and God is good why can't he change the hearts of men?
Well maybe God himself is lost and needs help
Maybe God himself he needs all of our help
Maybe God himself is lost and needs help
He's out upon the road to peace
Well maybe God himself is lost and needs help
Maybe God himself he needs all of our help
And he's lost upon the road to peace
And he's lost upon the road to peace
Out upon the road to peace.
Around the curve of The Parrot Bar
A brokendown old movie star
Hustling and Easterner
Bringing out the beast in her
A high dive on a swimming pool
Filled with needles and with fools
The memories are short but the tales are long
When you're in the Reeperbahn
Oh, they called her Rosie when she was a girl
For her bright red cheeks and her strawberry curls
When she would laugh the river would run
She said she'd be a comedian
Oh what a pity, oh what a shame
When she said, ‘come calling’, nobody came
Now her bright red cheeks are painted on
And she's laughing her head off in the Reeperbahn
Now little Hans was always strange
Wearing womens underthings
His father beat him but he wouldn't change
He ran off with a man one day
Now his lingerie is all the rage
In the black on every page
His father proudly calls his name
Down there in the Reeperbahn
Now if you've lost your inheritance
And all you've left is common sense
And you're not too picky about the crowd you keep
Or the mattress where you sleep
Behind every window, behind every door
The apple has gone but there's always the core
And the seeds will sprout up right through the floor
Down there in the Reeperbahn
Down there in the Reeperbahn
Down there in the Reeperbahn
she wore red shoes by the newstand
as the rain splashed the nickle
spilled like chablis along the midway
theres a little bluejay
in a red dress, on a sad night
one straw in a rootbeer
a compact with a cracked mirror
and a bottle of evening in paris perfume
whats this sad tune
he told her to wait by the magazines
he had to take care of some business it seems
bring a raincoat
and a suitcase
and your dark eyes
and wear those red shoes
theres a dark huddle at the bus stop
unbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet
Li'l cesar got caught
he has going down to second
he has cooled
changing stations on the chamber
to steal a diamond
from a jewelry store for his baby
he loved the way she looked
in those red shoes
she waited by the drugstore
cesaer had never been late before
and the dogs bayed the moon
and rattled their chains
and the cold jingle of taps in a puddle
was the burgler alarm
snitchin on cesaer
note the rain washes memories from the sidewalks
and the hounds splash down the nickle
full of soldiers
and santa claus is drunk in the ski room
and it's christmas eve
in a sad cafe
when the moon gets this way
ther's a little blue my
by the newstand
wearing red shoes
so meet me tonight by the drugstore
w're goin' out tonight
wear your red shoes
Inside a broken clock
Splashing the wine
With all the Rain Dogs
Taxi, we'd rather walk.
Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs
For i am a Rain Dog, too.
Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreamin
Oh, how we danced away
All of the lights
We've always been out of our minds.
The Rum pours strong and thin
Beat out the dustman
With the Rain Dogs
Aboard a shipwreck train
Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog, too.
Oh, how we danced with the
Rose of Tralee
Her long hair black as a raven
Oh, how we danced and you
Whispered to me
You'll never be going back home,
You'll never be going back home.
I guess things were always quiet around Putnam County
kind of shy and sleepy as it clung to the skirts
of the 2lane, that was stretched out like an
asphalt dance floor where all the oldtimers would
hunker down in bib jeans and store bought boots
lyin' about their lives and the places that they'd been
suckin' on Coca Colas and be spittin' Days Work
they's be suckin' on Coca Colas
and be spittin' Day's Work
until the moon was a stray dog on the ridge and
the taverns would be swollen until the naked eye
of 2am, and the Stratocaster guitars slung over
Burgermeister beer guts, and the swizzle stick legs
jacknifed over naugahyde stools and the
witch hazel spread out over the linoleum floors,
the pedal pushers stretched out over midriff bulge
and the coiffed brunette curls over Maybelline eyes
wearing Prince Machiavelli, Estee Lauder, smells so sweet
I elbowed up at the counter with mixed feelings
over mixed drinks
and Bubba and the Roadmasters moaned in pool hall
concentration as they knit their brows to
cover the entire Hank Williams Song Book
and the old National register was singing to the tune of 57.57
until last call, one last game of 8 ball
and Berneice would be putting the chairs on the tables,
someone come in say "Hey man, anyone got
any Jumper Cables, is that a 6 or a 12 volt?"
and all the studs in town would toss 'em down
and claim to fame as they stomped their feet
boasting about being able to get more ass
than a toilet seat.
And the GMCs and the Straight 8 Fords
were coughing and wheezing and they
perculated as they tossed the gravel
underneath the fenders to weave home
a wet slick anaconda of a two lane
with tire irons and crowbars a rattlin'
with a tool box and a pony saddle
you're grinding gears, shifting into first
yea and that goddam tranny's just getting worse
with the melodies of "see ya later"
and screwdrivers on carburettors
talkin' shop about money to loan
and palominos and strawberry roans
See ya tomorrow, hello to the Mrs.
money to borrow and goodnight kisses
the radio spittin' out Charlie Rich
sure can sing that sonofabitch
and you weave home, weavin' home
leaving the little joint winking in the
dark warm narcotic American night
beneath a pin cushion sky and it's
home to toast and honey, start
up the Ford, your lunch money's there on the
draining board, toilet's runnin' shake the
handle, telephone's ringin' it's Mrs Randal
where the hell are my goddam sandals
and the porcelain poodles and the glass swans
staring down from the knick knack shelf
with the parent permission slips for the kids' field trips
pair of Muckalucks scraping across
the shag carpet
and the impending squint of
first light, that lurked behind
a weeping marquee in downtown Putnam
and would be pullin' up any minute now
just like a bastard amber
Velveeta yellow cab on a rainy corner
and be blowin' its horn, in every window
well you can buy me a drink and i'll tell you what i seen
and i'll give you a bargain from the edge of a maniac's dream
that buys a black widow spider with a riddle in his yarn
that's clinging to the furrow of a blindman's brow
i'll start talking from the brim of a thimble full of whiskey
on a train through the bronx that will take you just as far
as the empty of a bottle to the highway of a scar
that stretched across the blacktop of my cheek like that
and then ducks beneath the brim of a fugitive's hat
and you'll learn why liquor makes a stool pigeon rat on every face
that ever left his shadow down on saint marks place
hell i'd double cross my mother if it was whiskey that they payed
and so an early bird says nightsticks on the hit parade
and he ain't got a prayer and his days are numbered
and you'll track him down like a dog
well it's a tough customer you're getting in this trade
Óause the nightstick's heart pumps lemonade
well whiskey keeps a blindman talkin alright
and i'm the only one who knows just where he stayed last night
he was in a wreckin yard in a switchblade storm
in a wheelbarrow with nothing but revenge to keep him warm
and a half a million dollars in unmarked bills
was the nightstick's blanket in a febuary chill
and as the buzzard drove a crooked sky
he was dealin high chicago in the mud
and stackin' the deck against a dragnet's eye
a shivering nightstick in a miserable heap
with the siren for a lullaby singing him to sleep
he was bleeding from a buttonhole
torn by a slug fired from the barrel of a two dollar gun
that scorched a blister on the grip of a punk by now
is learnin what you have to pay to be a hero anyhow
he dressed the hole in his gut with a hundred dollar bandage
a king's ransom for a bedspread that don't amount to nuttin
just cobweb strings on a busted ukulele
and the nightstick leaned on a black shillelagh
with the poison of a junkie's broken promise on his lip
he staggered in the shadows screaming i ain't never been afraid
and he shot out every street light on the promenade
past the frozen ham and eggers at the penny arcade
throwin out handfuls of a blood stained salary
they were dead in their tracks at the shootin gallery
and they fired off a twenty one gun salute
and from the corner of his eye he caught the alabaster orbs
and from a dime a dance hall girl and stuffed a thousand dollar bill
in her blouse and caught the cruel and unusual punishment of her smile
and the nightstick winked beneath a rainsoaked brim
ain't no one seen hide nor hair of him see
no one but a spade on rikers island and me
and so if you're mad enough to listen to a full of whiskey blindman
then you're mad enough to look beyond where bloodhounds dare to go
so if you want to know just where the nightstick's hidin out
you be down at the ferry landin oh let's say bout half past a nightmare
when it's twisted on a clock you tell 'em nickels sentcha
whiskey always makes him talk
and you ask for captain charon with the mud on his kicks
he's the skipper of the deadline steamer
and she sails from the bronx across the river styx
and a riddle's just a ticket for a dreamer
cause when the weathervane's sleepin and the moon turns his back
you crawl on your belly long the railroad tracks
and cross your heart and hope to die and stick a needle in your eye
cause he'd cut my bleedin heart out if he found out that i squealed
cause you see a scarecrow's just a hoodlum
who marked the cards that he dealed
and pulled a gypsy switch
out on the edge of potter's field
Did you hear the news about Edward?
On the back of his head he had another face
Was it a woman's face or a young girl?
They said to remove it would kill him
So poor Edward was doomed
The face could laugh and cry
It was his devil twin
And at night she spoke to him
Things heard only in hell
But they were impossible to separate
Chained together for life
Finally the bell tolled his doom
He took a suite of rooms
And hung himself and her from the balcony irons
Some still believe he was freed from her
But I knew her too well
I say she drove him to suicide
And took poor Edward to hell
I've seen it all boys
I've been all over
Been everywhere in the
Whole wide world
I rode the high line
With old blind Darby
I danced real slow
With Ida Jane
I was full of wonder
When I left Murfreesboro
Now I am full of hollow
On Maxwell street...
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home
I walked from Natcher
I built a fire by the side
Of the road
I worked for nothin in a
Belzoni saw mill. I caught a
Blind out on the B and O
Talullah's friendly Belzoni ain't so
A 44'll get you 99
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home
I run my race with burnt face Jake
Gave him a Manzanita cross
I lived on nothin
But dreams and train smoke
Somehow my watch and chain
I wish I was home in Evelyn's Kitchen
With old Gyp curled around my feet
I put my chips on her shoulder
running in the carnival time
she bought the things that I told her
they made her eyes sparkle and shine
together we'll ring in the new year
I know that she'll be my queen
and if I fall asleep in your arms
please wake me up in my dreams
Her outfit was all made of vinyl
like nothing I've ever seen
when our divorces are final
She'll fit right into my scheme
next to the pawnshop's a chapel
I'll show you just what I mean
and if I fall asleep in your arms
please wake me up in my dreams
The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
But I just know there's got to be more
So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain
And I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel but you're blind
If I exorcise my devils
Well my angels may leave too
When they leave they're so hard to find
And we're always at each other's throats
You know it drives me up the wall
But most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me
Baby I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame.
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
Every since I put your picture
In a frame
I'm gonna love you
Till the wheels come off
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame
Here comes the bride
And there goes the groom
Looks like a hurricane
Went thru this room
Smells like a poolhall
Where's my other shoe
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you
Looks like you spent the nite in a trench
And tell me,
How long have you been combing your hair with a wrench
Blue roses are dead
And the violets are too
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you
Well, I've told you before
I won't tell you again
You don't defrost the icebox
With a ball point pen
This railroad apartment
Is held together with glue
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you
Because I know
I been swindled
I never bargained for this
Once more you never cared about me
Why don't you get your own place
So you can live like you do
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you
Take all your relatives
And all of your shoes
Believe me I'll really swing
When you're gone
I'll be living on chicken and wine
After we're thru
With someone I pick up after you
With someone I'll pick up after you
With someone I'll pick up after you
with someone I'll pick up after you
Smelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp,
I ain't got a quarter, got a postage stamp
Been five o'clock shadow boxing all around the town,
Talking with the old man, sleeping on the ground
Bazanti bootin al zootin al hoot and Al Cohn
Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole
And a fishnet stocking, spikeheel shoes,
Strip tease, prick tease, car keys blues
And the porno floor show, live nude girls,
Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls
Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose
Raise my rent and take off all your clothes
With trench coats, magazines, a bottle full of rum,
She's so good, make a dead man come
Pasties and a Gstring, beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze
Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie and Fifi live from Gay Paree
Fanfares, rim shots, back stage, who cares, all this hot burlesque for me
Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips
Chopped and channeled and lowered and lewd
And the cheater slicks and baby moons
She's ahot and ready, creamy and sugared
And the band is awful and so are the tunes
Crawling on her belly, and shaking like jelly,
And I'm getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres
And cheers from the hmm compendium here
"Hey sweetheart" they're yelling for more
You're squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor
And I like Shelly, and you like Jane
And what was the girl with the snakeskin's name?
And it's an earlybird matinee, come back any day,
Get you a little something that you can't get at home
Get you a little something that you can't get at home
It's pasties and a Gstring, beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze
Popcorn, front row, higher than a kite, and I'll be back tomorrow night,
And I'll be back tomorrow night
Smelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp,

I wish I had a dollar for
Each time I took a chance
  twobit romeos
Who    romance
Somehow I was thinking of
Last time I fell down
Knowing that you fall in love
Once upon a town
There's a blue eyed girl with a red bow tie
and a string of pearls with one good eye
in a rainy town the chimney smoke will curl
no one likes clowns on the other side of the world
and the children know she'll never let me go.
there's a one legged priest that tangos with the farmers wife
Beauty and the beast is taking her own life
and a tear on a letter back home turns into a lake of your own
and a crow turns into a girl on the other side of the world
and she tastes like the sea and she's waiting for me
in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.
And I drink champagne from your thin blue veins
She visits his grave wearing her mother's shawl
should I shave or end it all.
There's an old sailor song that the children know
as their fingers curl around the other side of the world
on a bone white mare lost in Kathleen's hair
in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.
sticks and stones will break my bones, but i always will be true, and when
your mama is dead and gone, i'll sing this lullabye just for you, and what
becomes of all the little boys, who never comb their hair, well they're lined
up all around the block, on the nickel over there.
so you better bring a bucket, there is a hole in the pail, and if you don't
get my letter, then you'll know that i'm in jail, and what becomes of all the
little boys, who never say their prayers, well they're sleepin' like a baby,
on the nickel over there.
and if you chew tobacco, and wish upon a star, well you'll find out where
the scarecrows sit, just like punchlines between the cars, and i know a place
where a royal flush, can never beat a pair, and even thomas jefferson, is on
the nickel over there.
so ring around the rosie, you're sleepin' in the rain, and you're always
late for supper, and man you let me down again, i thought i heard a
mockingbird, roosevelt knows where, you can skip the light, with grady tuck,
on the nickel over there.
so what becomes of all the little boys, who run away from home, well the
world just keeps gettin' bigger, once you get out on your own, so here's to
all the little boys, the sandman takes you where, you'll be sleepin' with a
pillowman, on the nickel over there.
so let's climb up through that button hole, and we'll fall right up the
stairs, and i'll show you where the short dogs grow, on the nickel over there
on a foggy night, an abandoned road
in a twilight mirror mirage
with no indication of a service station
or an all night garage, I was misinformed
I was misdirected cause the interchange
never intersected leaving me marooned
beneath a bloodshot moon
all upon a foggy night, on a foggy night
an abandoned road, in a blurred brocade
collage, is that a road motel?
I can't really tell, is that what you
might call some kind of a vacancy lodge
cause there's no consolation, what
kind of situation to be aimlessly skewed
amidst a powder blue?
no tell tail light clue
spun like the spell you spin
this precarious pandemonium
I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night
all upon a foggy night
on a foggy night
I'm singing this song, it's time it was sung
I've been putting it off for a while,
But it's harder by now, 'cause the truth is so clear
That I cry when I'm seeing you smile.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
Every time that I tried to tell
that we'd lost the magic we had at the start,
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I searched once again for the spark.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you to cry in the rain,
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone,
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone,
can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
she wore red shoes by the newstand
as the rain splashed the nickle
spilled like chablis along the midway
theres a little bluejay
in a red dress, on a sad night
one straw in a rootbeer
a compact with a cracked mirror
and a bottle of evening in paris perfume
whats this sad tune
he told her to wait by the magazines
he had to take care of some business it seems
bring a raincoat
and a suitcase
and your dark eyes
and wear those red shoes
theres a dark huddle at the bus stop
unbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet
Li'l cesar got caught
he has going down to second
he has cooled
changing stations on the chamber
to steal a diamond
from a jewelry store for his baby
he loved the way she looked
in those red shoes
she waited by the drugstore
cesaer had never been late before
and the dogs bayed the moon
and rattled their chains
and the cold jingle of taps in a puddle
was the burgler alarm
snitchin on cesaer
note the rain washes memories from the sidewalks
and the hounds splash down the nickle
full of soldiers
and santa claus is drunk in the ski room
and it's christmas eve
in a sad cafe
when the moon gets this way
ther's a little blue my
by the newstand
wearing red shoes
so meet me tonight by the drugstore
w're goin' out tonight
wear your red shoes
Lost in the pocket of your overcoat,
Like burned out lite bulbs on a Ferris Wheel.
Old Boy friends,
You remember the kinds of cars they drove,
Parking in an orange grove.
He fell in love you see,
With someone that I used to be.
Tho I very seldom think of him,
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue satin dress can make the window
Like a dream
Ah but now those dreams belong to someone else,
Now they talk endlessly
In a drawer where I keep
Remember when you were burning for them?
Why do you keep turning them into
They look you up when they're in town
To see if they can still burn you down
You fell in love you see
With someone that I used to be
Turn up every time it rains,
Fall out of the pages in a magazine
Girls fill up the bars every spring,
Not places for remembering.
All my old boyfriends
Well, my time went so quickly, I went licketysplitly
out to my ol' fiftyfive.
As I pulled away slowly feelin' so holy
God knows I was feelin' alive.
And now the sun's comin' up,
I'm ridin' with Lady Luck,
freeway cars and trucks.
Stars beginning to fade
and I lead the parade
just a wishin' I'd stayed a little longer.
Lord, don't you know the feelin's gettin' stronger.
Six in the mornin' gave me no warnin',
I had to be on my way.
Now the cars are all passin' me, trucks are all flashin' me,
I'm headed home from your place.
And now the sun's comin' up,
I'm ridin' with Lady Luck,
freeway cars and trucks.
Stars beginning to fade
and I lead the parade
just a wishin' I'd stayed a little longer.
Lord, don't you know the feelin's gettin' stronger.
Well, my time went so quickly, I went licketysplitly
out to my ol' fiftyfive.
As I pulled away slowly feelin' so holy
God knows I was feelin' alive.
And now the sun's comin' up, yes it is,
I'm ridin' with Lady Luck,
freeway cars and trucks.
Freeway cars and trucks
ridin' with Lady Luck.
Freeway cars and trucks
ridin' with Lady Luck.
Freeway cars and trucks
ridin' with Lady Luck.
It only believes
In a pile of dead leaves
And a moon
That's the color of bone
No prayers for November
To linger longer
Stick your spoon in the wall
We'll slaughter them all
November has tied me
To an old dead tree
Get word to April
To rescue me
November's cold chain
Made of wet boots and rain
And shiny black ravens
On chimney smoke lanes
November seems odd
You're my firing squad
With my hair slicked back
With carrion shellac
With the blood from a pheasant
And the bone from a hare
Tied to the branches
Of a roebuck stag
Left to wave in the timber
Like a buck shot flag
Go away you rainsnout
Go away, blow your brains out
will ever love you
the way I could love you
cause nobody is that strong
love is bitter sweet
and life's treasures deep
but no one can keep
a love that's gone wrong
will ever love you
the way I could love you
cause nobody's that strong
cause nobody's that strong
will ever love you
the way I could love you
cause nobody is that strong
you've had many lovers
you'll have many others
but they'll only just break
your poor heart in two
will ever love you
the way I could love you
cause nobody's that strong
cause nobody's that strong
Hell above and Heaven below
All the trees are gone
The rain made such a lovely sound
To those who are six feet under ground
The leaves will bury every year
And no one knows I’m gone
Live me golden tell me dark
Hide from Graveyard John
The moon is full here every night
And I can bathe here in his light
The leaves will bury every year
And no one knows I’m gone
there's a blur drizzle down the plateglass
as a neon swizzle stick stirrin up the sultry night air
and a yellow biscuit of a buttery cue ball moon
rollin' maverick across an obsidian sky
as the busses go groanin' and wheezin',
down on the corner I'm freezin'
on a restless boulevard at a midnight road
I'm across town from EASY STREET
with the tight knots of moviegoers and out of towners on the stroll
and the buildings towering high above
lit like dominoes or black dice
all the used car salesmen dressed up in Purina Checkerboard slacks
and Foster Grant wraparound,
pacing in front of EARL SCHLEIB 39.95 merchandise
like barkers at a shootin' gallery
they throw out kind of a Texas Guinan routine
"Hello sucker, we like your money
just as well as anybody else's here"
or they give you the P.T. Barnum bit
"There's a sucker born every minute
you just happened to be comin' along at the right time"
come over here now
you know... all the harlequin sailors are on the stroll
in a search of "LIKE NEW," "NEW PAINT,"
decent factory air and AMFM dreams
and the piss yellow gypsy cabs
stacked up in the taxi zones waitin' like pinball machines
to be ticking off a joy ride to a magical place
waitin' in line like "truckers welcome" diners
with dirt lots full of
Peterbilts, Kenworths, Jimmy's and the like, and
they're hiballin' with bankrupt brakes, over driven
under paid, over fed, a day late and a dollar short
but Christ I got my lips around a bottle and
my foot on the throttle and I'm standin' on the corner
standin' on the corner like a "just in town"
jasper, on a street corner with a gasper lookin'
for some kind of Cheshire billboard grin
stroking a goateed chin, and using parking meters
as walking sticks on the inebriated stroll
with my eyelids propped open at half mast
but you know... over at Chubb's Pool Hall and Snooker
it was a nickle after two, yea it was a nickle after two
and in the cobalt steel blue dream smoke, it
was the radio that groaned out the hit parade
and the chalk squeaked, the floorboards creaked
and an Olympia sign winked through a torn yellow
shade, old Jack Chance himself leanin' up against
a Wurlitzer and eyeballin' out a 5 ball combination shot
impossible you say? ...hard to believe?, perhaps
out of the realm of possibility? naaaa
he be stretchin' out long tawny fingers out across a
cool green felt with a provocative golden gate
and a full table railshot that's no sweat and I leaned
up against my bannister and wandered over to the
Wurlitzer and I punched A2 I was lookin' for
something like Wine, Wine, Wine by the Night Caps
starring Chuck E. Weiss or High Blood Pressure
by George cryin' in the streets Perkins  no dice
"that's life," that's what all the people say ridin' high
in April, seriously shot down in May, but I know I'm
gonna change that tune when I'm standing underneath
a buttery moon that's all melted off to one side
It was just about that time that the sun
came crawlin' yellow out of a manhole
at the foot of 23rd Street
and a dracula moon in a black disguise
was making its way back to its
prepaid room at the St. Moritz Hotel scat
and the El train came tumbling
across the trestles and it sounded
like the ghost of Gene Krupa
with an overhead cam and glasspacks
and the whispering brushes of wet radials
on a wet pavement and there's a
traffic jam session on Belmont tonight
and the rhapsody of the pending
evening, I leaned up against
my bannister and I've been looking
for some kind of an emotional
investment with romantic dividends
kind of a physical negociation
as I attempt to consolidate all my
missed weekly payments, into
through the nose
with romantic residuals and leg akimbo
but the chances are more than likely I'll probably
be held over for another smashed weekend
there's a blur drizzle down the plateglass
as a neon swizzle stick stirrin up the sultry night air
and a yellow biscuit of a buttery cue ball moon
rollin' maverick across an obsidian sky
as the busses go groanin' and wheezin',
down on the corner I'm freezin'
on a restless boulevard at a midnight road
I'm across town from EASY STREET
with the tight knots of moviegoers and out of towners

"There's a sucker born every minute
you just happened to be comin' along at the right time"
come over here now
you know... all the harlequin sailors are on the stroll
in a search of "LIKE NEW," "NEW PAINT,"
decent factory air and AMFM dreams
and the piss yellow gypsy cabs
stacked up in the taxi zones waitin' like
to be ticking off a joy ride to a magical place
waitin' in line like "truckers welcome" diners
with dirt lots full of
Peterbilts, Kenworths, Jimmy's and the like, and
they're hiballin' with bankrupt brakes, over driven
under paid, over fed, a day late and a dollar short
but Christ I got my lips around a bottle and
my foot on the throttle and I'm standin' on the corner
standin' on the corner like a "just in town"
jasper, on a street corner with a gasper lookin
' for some kind of Cheshire billboard grin
stroking a goateed chin, and using parking meters
as walking sticks on the inebriated stroll
with my eyelids propped open at half mast
but you know... over at Chubb's Pool Hall and Snooker
it was a nickle after two, yea it was a nickle after two
and in the cobalt steel blue dream smoke, it
was the radio that groaned out the hit parade
and the chalk squeaked, the floorboards creaked
and an Olympia sign winked through a torn yellow
shade, old Jack Chance himself leanin' up against
a Wurlitzer and eyeballin' out a 5 ball combination shot
impossible you say? ...hard to believe?, perhaps
out of the realm of possibility? naaaa
he be stretchin' out long tawny fingers out across a
cool green felt with a provocative golden gate
and a full table railshot that's no sweat and I leaned
up against my bannister and wandered over to the
Wurlitzer and I punched A2 I was lookin' for
something like Wine, Wine, Wine by the Night Caps
starring Chuck E. Weiss or High Blood Pressure
by George cryin' in the streets Perkins  no dice
"that's life," that's what all the people say ridin' high
in April, seriously shot down in May, but I know I'm
gonna change that tune when I'm standing underneath
a buttery moon that's all melted off to one side
It was just about that time that the sun
came crawlin' yellow out of a manhole
at the foot of 23rd Street
and a dracula moon in a black disguise
was making its way back to its
prepaid room at the St. Moritz Hotel scat
and the El train came tumbling across the trestles and it sounded
like the ghost of Gene Krupa
with an overhead cam and glasspacks
and the whispering brushes of wet radials
on a wet pavement and there's a
traffic jam session on Belmont tonight
and the rhapsody of the pending
evening, I leaned up against
my bannister and I've been looking
for some kind of an emotional
investment with romantic dividends
kind of a physical negociation
as I attempt to consolidate all my
missed weekly payments, into
through the nose
with romantic residuals and leg akimbo
but the chances are more than likely I'll probably
be held over for another smashed weekend
Let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down.
You wear a dress, baby, and I'll wear a tie.
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky
All your scribbled lovedreams, are lost or thrown away,
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowing day
Our love needs a transfusion so let's shoot it full of wine
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin'in your line.
muriel since you left town the clubs closed down
and there's one more burned out lamppost down on the main street
down where we used to stroll
and muriel i still hit all the same old haunts
and you follow me wherever i go
and muriel i see you on a saturday night
in a penny arcade with your hair tied back
and the diamond twinkle in your eye
is the only wedding ring i'll buy you
and muriel how many times i've left this town
to hide from your memory
and it haunts me
but i only get as far as the next whiskey bar
i buy another cheap cigar and i'll see you every night
hey muriel muriel
hey buddy got a light
There was a murder in the red barn
Murder in the red barn
The trees are bending over
The cows are lying down
The autumn's taking over
You can hear the buckshot hounds
The watchman said to Reba the loon
Was it pale at Manzanita
Or Blind Bob the coon?
Pin it on a drifter
They sleep beneath the bridge
One plays the violin
And sleeps inside a fridge
There was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
Someone's crying in the woods
Someone's burying all his clothes
Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer
Slept outside last night and froze
Road kill has its seasons
Just like anything
It's possums in the autumn
And it's farm cats in the spring
There was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house
Or covet thy neighbor's wife
But for some
Murder is the only door through which they enter life
Now they surrounded the house
They smoke him out
They took him off in chains
The sky turned black and bruised
And we had months of heavy rains
Now the raven's nest in the rotted roof
Of Chenoweth's old place
And no one's asking Cal
About that scar upon his face
'Cause there's nothin' strange
About an axe with bloodstains in the barn
There's always some killin'
You got to do around the farm
A murder in the red barn
Murder in the red barn
Now the woods will never tell
What sleeps beneath the trees
Or what's buried 'neath a rock
Or hiding in the leaves
'Cause road kill has it's seasons
Just like anything
It's possums in the autumn
And it's farm cats in the spring
A murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
Now a lady can't do nothin'
Without folks' tongues waggin'
Is this blood on the tree
Or is it autumn's red blaze
When the ground's soft for diggin'
ANd the rain will bring all this gloom
There's nothing wrong with a lady
Drinking alone in her room
But there was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
i spent all my money in a mexican whorehouse, across the street from a
catholic church, and then i wiped off my revolver, and i buttoned up my
burgundy shirt, i shot the morning in the back, with my red wings on, i told
the sun he'd better go back down, and if i can find a book of matches, i'm
goin' to burn this hotel down.
you got to tell me brave captain, why are the wicked so strong, how do the
angels get to sleep, when the devil leaves the porchlight on.
well i dropped thirty grand on the nugget slots, i had to sell my ass on
fremont street, and the drummer said there's sanctuary, over at the bagdad
room, and now it's one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready,
and go man go, i said tell me mr. siegel, how do i get out of here.
well willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat, drivin' dangerous curves
across the dirty sheets, he said man you ought to see her, when her parents
are gone, man you ought to hear her when the siren's on.
you got to tell me brave captain, why are the wicked so strong, how do the
angels get to sleep, when the devil leaves the porchlight on.
don't you know that ain't no broken bottle, that i picked up in my
headlights, on the other side of the nevada line, where they live hard die
young, and have a good lookin' corpse every time, well the pitboss said i
should keep movin', this is where you go when you die, and so i shot a black
beauty, and i kissed her right between the eyes.
well willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat, drivin' dangerous curves
across the dirty sheets, he said when the bitch is wound up, and her parents
are gone, man you ought to hear her with the siren on.
you got to tell me brave captain, why are the wicked so strong, how do the
angels get to sleep, when the devil leaves the porchlight on.
Mr. Henry stumbles home
When the evening's done
He's as poor as a church mouse
High on the Meyer's rum
Tugging at his shirttail
Jiggling a church key
Chewing on a toothpick
On another binge
Trampling the rosebush
Whistin' to himself...
Now don't wake up the neighbours
Spitting on the hinge
Rattling the milkbottles
Tripping on a skate
Hidin' from the Newsboys
Before it's too late
The Screen door's open
Don't make no noise in the Kitchen
Got no excuse
For a cold, grey wife that starts bitchin'
That the no good bum's at it again
After she's given him
The best years of her life
He'll tell her he was celebrating
Played a hunch out at Yonkers
You can never trust a horse
And thrown in jail
Swore he'd never do these things again
He's got an alibi
But never tells her where he's been
It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight
it's more than thunder it's more than thunder
it's more than a swindle this crooked card game
it's more than sad times it's more than sad times
none of our pockets are filled with gold
nobody's caught the boquet
there are no dead presidents we can fold
nothing is going our way
and it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
it's more than woebegotten grey skies now
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
The higher that the monkey can climb
The more he shows his tail
Call no man happy 'til he dies
There's no milk at the bottom of the pail
God builds a church
The devil builds a chapel
Like the thistles that are growing
'round the thrunk of a tree
All the good in the world
You can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me
If there's one thing you can say
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitch fork
But it always comes roaring back again
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
For want of a bird
The sky was last
For want of a nail
A shoe was last
For want of a life
The knife was last
For want of a toy
A child was last
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
Everybody Row! Everybody Row!
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
Everybody Row! Everybody Row!
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye
Husha bye my baby, no need to be crying.
You can burn the midnight oil with me as long as you will
Stare out at the moon upon the windowsill, and dream...
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye
Husha bye my baby, no need to be crying.
There's dew drops on the window sill, gumdrops in your head
Slipping into dream land, you're nodding your head, so dream...
Dream of West Virginia, or of the British Isles
'Cause when you are dreaming, you see for miles and miles.
When you are much older, remember when we sat
At midnight on the windowsill, and had this little chat
And dream, come on and dream, come on and dream, and dream, and dream...
Are you ready, are you ready
Knocky Parker told Bowlegged Sal
They all know how to kick it in Cal
They're playing this dope and this
Dancing baby with a 7 mile broom
Things are bulging out the rafters
Dddddown there at the Hush Hotel
They're jumping right out of their
Seats, dancing to the bran' new beat
The floor is polished and you
You can quake and roll and moan
29 gypsies in a Caddilac stoned
Turn off the ringer on your cellular phone
Whip the air like a Rainbow Trout
Drag your tail pipe till you bottom out
The low bottom of the china moon
The black swan and the way too soon
Ace pocket and teh dog bone gone
The peacock and the mean black swan
The rain shower and high heeled shoe
Bombay money and I know I can do it
The sink hole and the victory dance
Its in the pocket in the real tight pants
Show your teeth bray like a falf
You kill me with your machine gun laugh
You make me trouble with the floor
I"ve been ready to ka boom for a week
Put on your stockings and your powder and blush
Keep it all on the hush, hush, hush
Operator, number, please it's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears?
Hello, hello there, is this Martha? this is old Tom Frost,
And I am calling long distance, don't worry 'bout the cost.
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now Martha please recall,
Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all.
And those were the days of roses, poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me.
There was no tomorrows, we'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day.
And I feel so much older now, and you're much older too,
How's your husband? and how's the kids? you know that I got married too?
Luck that you found someone to make you feel secure,
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature.
And those were the days of roses, poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me.
There was no tomorrows, we'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day.
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am,
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man.
I guess that our being together was never meant to be.
And Martha, Martha, I love you can't you see?
And those were the days of roses, poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me.
There was no tomorrows, we'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day.
And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to you...
She took all my money
And my best friend
You know the story
Here it comes again
I have no pride
I have no shame
You gotta make it rain
Make it rain!
Since you're gone
Deep inside it hurts
I'm just another sad guest
On this dark earth
I want to believe
In the mercy of the world again
Make it rain, make it rain!
The nite's too quiet
Stretched out alone
I need the whip of thunder
And the wind's dark moan
I'm not Able, I'm just Cain
Open up the heavens
Make it rain!
I'm close to heaven
Crushed at the gate
They sharpen their knives
On my mistakes
What she done, you can't give it a name
You gotta make it rain
Make it rain, yeah!
Without her love
Withour your kiss
Hell can't burn me
More than this
I'm burning up all this pain
Put out the fire
Make it rain!
I'm born to trouble
I'm born to fate
Inside a promise
I can't escape
It's the same old world
But nothing looks the same
Got to make it rain
Make it rain
You got to make it rain
Got to make it rain
You got to...
Sun is red moon is cracked
Daddy's never coming back
Nothing's ever yours to keep
Close your eyes, go to sleep
If I die before you wake
Don't you cry, don't you weep
Nothing's ever as it seems
Climb the ladder to you dreams
If I die before you wake
Don't you cry, don't you weep
Nothing's ever yours to keep
Close your eyes go to sleep

The prettiest girl
In all the world
Is in a little Spanish town
But I left her for a Bonnie lass
And I told her
I'd see her around
But that Bonnie lass
And her heart of glass
Would not hold a candle
To bumming around
So don't cry for me
For I'm going away
And I'll be back some lucky day
Tell the boys back home
I'm doing just fine
I left my troubles and woe
So sing about me
For I can't come home
I've many more miles to go
Why, there's Miss Kelsey
You taught dance at our school
And old Johnny O'Toole
I'll still beat you at pool
So don't cry for me
For I'm going away
ANd I'll be back some lucky day
Now when I was a boy
My daddy sat me on his knee
And he told me
He told me many things
And he said sone
There's a lot of things in this world
You're gonna have no use for
ANd when you get blue
And you've lost all your dreams
There's nothin' like a campfire
And a can of beans
Why, there's Miss Kelsey
She taught dance at our school
And old Johnny O'Toole
I'll still beat you at pool
So don't cry for me
For I'm going away
And I'll be back some lucky day
Well, they call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long I'll be dead
Now, her hair was as black as a bucket of tar
Her skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
Now I'll never see heaven or home
I made a wish on a sliver of moonlight
A sly grin and a bowl full of stars
Like a kid who captures a firefly
And leaves it only to die in the jar
As I kick at the clouds at my hanging
As I swing out over the crowd
I will search every face for Lucinda's
And she will go off with me down to hell
I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I cast this burden on the god that's within me
And I'll leave this old world and go free
The devil dances inside empty pockets
But she never wanted money or pearls
No, that wasn't enough for Lucinda
She wasn't that kind of girl
Now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda
Whoever thought that hell be'd so low
I did well for an old tin can sailor
But she wanted the bell in my soul
I've spoken the god on the mountain
And I've swam in the Irish sea
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges
And I'll beg there for mercy for me
I thought I'd broke loose from Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I was standing outside the Whitehorse
Oh but I was afraid to go in
I heard someone pull the trigger
Her breasts heaved in the moonlight again
There was a smear of gold in the window
And then I was the jewel of her sin
They call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long I'll be dead
Now her hair was a black as a bucket of tar
Skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
I know I'll never see heaven or home
I know I'll never see heaven or home
I know I'll never see heaven or home
She's a crooked sheriff in a real straight town
She openend the door, shake shake shake the lights go down
Clover honey and the Jimson Weed
Red leather skirt way up above her knees
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown
She's a gone lost dirt road
There ain't no way back I been told
Well she's a story they all tell
She's a rebel, she's a yell
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown
White heat in a cold rain
I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane
Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al
The second hand moon's shining for my gal
She's a big red flag in a mean bullpen
She'll steal it from you, sell it right back to you again
Well, she's a wild rose, she's not settled
Cold gun of ice blue metal,
Oh, my baby's lowdown
White heat in a cold rain
I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane
Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al
She's a cheap motel with a burned out sign
She'll take care of you definitely every time
She got a stolen check book and legs up to there
Singing into a hairbrush, right in front of the mirror
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown
Over here the ladies all want sweet perfume
But there's never a rose
And over the roses are frightened to bloom
So they never can grow
And over here they need wool
For weaving their baby's new clothes
But nobody has any wool
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour
Lost in the harbour
And over here they want diamonds to wear
But there aren't any here
And over there everyone's hiding their tears
But they're crying inside
And the wall won't come down
Till they're no longer afraid of themselves
And if you don't believe me ask yourselves
And then I can come down to the harbour
Down to the harbour
And then I will fill the ocean back up with my tears
I still have a couple more years
And then I can come back to the harbour
Down to the harbour
Woah I, know I've been changed
And I know I've been changed
I know I've been changed
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Well, I know I got religion,
Lord knows I'm not ashamed
Well, a holy ghost is my witness
And the angels done sign my name
Oh, I said I know I've been changed
And I know I've been changed, yeah
Know I've been changed
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Lord knows I've been converted
Lord knows I've been redeemed
Well, you can wake me up in the midnight hour
I'm gonna tell ya just a what I seen
I said I know I've been changed
And I know I've been changed, yeah
Know I've been changed
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name
Angels in heaven done sign my name

Lazy trip to heaven on the wings of your love
Banana moon is shining in the sky,
Feel like I'm in heaven when you're with me
Know that I'm in heaven when you smile,
Though we're stuck here on the ground, I got something that I've found
And it's you.
And I don't have to take no trip to outer space
All I have to do is look at your face,
And before I know it, I'm in orbit around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I've found you,
When I see your constellation, honey, you're my inspiration, and it's you.
You're my north star when I'm lost and feeling blue,
The sun is breaking through the clouds don't you, don't you know it's true?
Honey, all the other stars seem dim around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I've found you,
When I see your smiling face, honey,
I know nothing ever going to take your place, and it's you.
And it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you
And it's you, and it's you, shoobedoo, badada.

I like my town with a little drop of poison
Nobody knows they're lining up to go insane
I'm all alone, I smoke my friends down to the filter
But I feel much cleaner after it rains
She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
Did the devil make the world while god was sleeping
Someone said you'll never get a wish from a bone
Another wrong goodbye and a hundred sailors
That deep blue sky is my home
She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
She left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
A rat always knows when he's in with weasels
Here you lose a little every day
I remember when a million was a million
They all have ways to make you pay
They all have ways to make you pay
Little Boy Blue
come blow your horn
the dish ran away with the spoon
home again home again
never gets up before noon
she used to render
you legal and tender
when you used to
send her your promises boy
a dill or a dollar
unbutton your collar
come out and holler
out all of your noise
little boy blue
come blow your top
cut it rite down to the quick
don't sit home and cry

around now you're hittin' bricks
now she disappeared
now everything's Canada dry
so watch your behavior
and rattle your cane
with a bottle of bourbon
little boy blow
lost little bo peep
she fell thru a hole in the nest
Now ain't it peculiar
that she's finally cooled your
big wheels just like all of the rest
whenever it rains
the umbrella complain
they're always gettin' played for a chump
so mark and strike it
she's history now
and you're hangin' out at the pump
Little Boy Blue...
she used to render...

and scratch your initials on my arm
and i'll show you how to sneak up
on the roof of the drugstore
take the spokes from your wheelchair
and a magpies wings
and tie em to your shoulders and your feet
i'll steal a hacksaw from my dad
and cut the braces off your legs
and we'll bury them tonight in the cornfield
put a church keey in your pocket
we'll hop that freight train in the hall
and we'll slide down the drain all the way
to new orleans in the fall
There is a light in the forest
There is a face in the tree
And the first one's always free
You can never go hunting
With just a flintlock and a hound
You won't go home with a bunting
If you blow a hundred rounds
It takes much more than wild courage
Or you'll hit just the tattered clouds
You must have just the right bullets
And the first one's always free
You must be careful in the forest
Broken glass and rusty nails
If you're to bring back something for us
I have bullets for sale
Why be a fool when you can chase away
Your blind and your gloom
I have blessed each one of these bullets
And they shine just like a spoon
To have sixty silver wishes
Is a small price to pay
They'll be your private little fishes
And they'll never swim away
I just want you to be happy
That's my only wish
I'll fix your wagon and your musket
And the spoon will have his dish
And I shudder at the thought of your
Poor empty hunter's pouch
So I'll keep the wind from your barrel
And bless the roof of your house
She's my only true love
she's all that I think of
look here in my wallet
She grew up on a farm there
there's a place on my arm
where I've written her name
next to mine
you see I just can't
live without her
and I'm her only boy
and she grew up outside McHenry
in Johnsburg, Illinois
Edna Million in a drop dead suit
Dutch pink pink on a downtown train
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner in the pouring rain
16 men on a deadman's chest
And I've been drinking from a broken cup
2 pairs of pants and a mother vest
I'm full of bourbon I can't stand up.
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire your children are alone
Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head
And I've been stepping on the devil's tail
Across the stripes of full moon's head
Through the bars of a Cuban jail
Bloody fingers on a purple knife
A flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass
I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife
Come admire the view from up on top of the mast
Yellow sheets in Hong Kong bed
Stazybo horn and a Singerland ride
To the carnival is what she said
A hundred dollars makes it dark inside.
Well, I'm a jitterbug boy
by the shoeshine
resting on my laurels
and my Hardys too
life of Riley on a swing shift
gears follow my drift
Once upon a time I was
in showbiz too
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers
playin at Ebbets Field
seen the Kentucky Derby too
it's fast women, slow horses, I'm reliable sources
and I'm holding up a lamp post
if you want to know
I seen the Wabash Cannonball,
buddy, I've done it all
beause I slept with the lions
and Marilyn Monroe
had breakfast in the eye
of a hurricane
fought Rocky Marciano,
played Minnesota Fats
burned hundreddollar bills,
I eaten Mulligan stew
got drunk with Louis Armstrong
what's that old song?
I taught Mickey Mantle
everything that he knows
and so you ask me
what I'm doing here
holding up a lamp post
flippin this quarter,
trying to make up my mind
and if it's heads I'll go to
Tennessee, and tails I'll buy a drink
if it lands on the edge
I'll keep talking to you
Well, Jesus will be here
Be here soon
he's gonna cover us up with leaves
With a blanket from the moon
With a promise and a vow
And a lullaby for my brow
Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon
Well I'm just gonna wait here
I don't have to shout
I have no reason and
I have no doubt
I'm gonna get myself
Unfurled from this mortal coiled up world
Because Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon
I got to keep my eyes open
So I can see my Lord
I'm gonna watch the horizon
For a brand new Ford
I can hear him rolling on down the lane
I said Hollywood be thy name
Jesus gonna be
Gonna be here soon
Well I've been faithful
And I've been so good
Except for drinking
But he new that I would
I'm gonna leave this place better
Than the way I found it was
And Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon
got no time for the corner boys, down in the street makin' all that noise,
don't want no whores on eighth avenue, cause tonight i'm gonna be with you.
cause tonight i'm gonna take that ride, across the river to the jersey side,
take my baby to the carnival, and i'll take you on all the rides, sing sha la
la la la la sha la la la.
down the shore everything's alright, you with your baby on a saturday night,
don't you know that all my dreams come true, when i'm walkin' down the street
with you, sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.
you know she thrills me with all her charms, when i'm wrapped up in my
baby's arms, my little angel gives me everything, i know someday that she'll
wear my ring.
so don't bother me cause i got no time, i'm on my way to see that girl of
mine, nothin' else matters in this whole wide world, when you're in love with
a jersey girl, sing sha la la la la la la.
and i call your name, i can't sleep at night, sha la la la la la la
I can see clearly nothing as clear
I keep falling apart ev'ry year
Let's take a hammer to it
There's no glamour in it
Is there any way out of this dream
I'm as blue as I can possibly be
Is there someone else out there for me
Summer is dragging it's feet
I feel so incomplete
Is there any way out of this dream
Well she's up against the register with
an apron and a spatula,
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue
She said "How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?",
You say "Anyway's the only way", be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here
In a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
But a brokendown jalopy of a man I left behind
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze
And an open invitation to the blues
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candyapple Caddy,
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night,
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So they took the registration, and the carkeys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation to the blues
'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring,
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose,
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues
The bats are in the belfry
the dew is on the moor
where are the arms that held me
and pledged her love before
and pledged her love before
It's such a sad old feeling
the fields are soft and green
it's memories that I'm stelaing
but you're innocent when you dream
when you dream
you're innocent when you dream
running through the graveyard
we laughed my friends and I
we swore we'd be together
until the day we died
until the day we died
I made a golden promise
that we would never part
I gave my love a locket
and then I broke her heart
and then I broke her heart
Well the eggs chase the bacon
round the fryin' pan
and the whinin' dog pidgeons
by the steeple bell rope
and the dogs tipped the garbage pails
over last night
and there's always construction work
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
Friday's a funeral
and Saturday's a bride
Sey's got a pistol on the register side
and the goddamn delivery trucks
they make too much noise
and we don't get our butter
delivered no more
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
Well Big Mambo's kicking
his old grey hound
and the kids can't get ice cream
'cause the market burned down
and the newspaper sleeping bags
blow down the lane
and that goddamn flatbed's
got me pinned in again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
There's a couple Filipino girls
gigglin' by the church
and the windoe is busted
and the landlord ain't home
and Butch joined the army
yea that's where he's been
and the jackhammer's diggin'
up the sidewalks again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
The women all control their men
With razors and with wrists
And the princess squeezes grape juice
On a torrid bloody kiss
What will you be wearing there
The lion or the raven hair?
The flesh will all be tearing
But the tail will be my own
In the colosseum tonight
This one's for the balcony
And this one's for the floor
As the senators decapitate
The presidential whore
The bald headed senators
Are splashing in the blood
The dogs are having someone
WHo is screaming in the mud
In the colosseum tonight
Now it's raining and it's pouring
On the pillaging and goring
The constable is swinging
>From the chains
For the dead there is no story
No memory no blame
Their families shout blue murder
But tomorrow it's the same
In the colosseum
A slowly acting poison
Will be given to the favorite one
THe dark horse will bring glory
To the jailer and his men
It's always much more sporting
When there's families in the pit
And the madness of the crowd
Is an epileptic fit
In the colosseum
No justice here, no liberty
No reason, no blame
There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood
And greetings from the nation
As we shake the hands of time
They're taking their ovations
The vultures stay behind
In the colosseum, in the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
I'll be clickin' by your house about two fortyfive
Sidewalk sundae strawberry surprise,
I got a cherry popsicle right on time
A big stick, mamma, that'll blow your mind
'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a oneman band yeah
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.
Baby, missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
Come back around and don't forget,
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool,
Got something better than a swimming pool
'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a oneman band
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.
'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a oneman band
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.
See me coming, you ain't got no change
Don't worry baby, it can be arranged
Show me you can smile, baby just for me
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free
'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a oneman band
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.
Be good to you, be good to you,
Good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah,
Good to you yeah, good to you, I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you...
Well I got here at eight and I'll be here till two
I'll try my best to entertain you and
Please don't mind me if I get a bit crude
I'm your late night evening prostitute
So drink your martinis and stare at the moon
Don't mind me I'll continue to croon
Don't mind me if I get a bit loon
I'm your late night evening prostitute
And dance, have a good time
I'll continue to shine
Yes Dance, have a good time
Don't mind me if I slip upon a rhyme
Well I got here at eight and I'll be here till two
I'll try my best to entertain you and
Please don't mind me if I get a bit crude
I'm your late night evening prostitute
I'm your late night evening prostitute
You haven't looked at me that way in years
You dreamed me up and left me here
How long was I dreaming for
What was it you wanted me for
You haven't looked at me that way in years
Your watch has stopped and the pond is clear
Someone turn the lights back off
I'll love you til all time is gone
You haven't looked at me that way in years
But I'm still here
I'll tip the newsboy
I'll get a shine
I'll ride this dream
to the end of the line
I'm goin places
I'll take a ride
Up to the Riverside
I'll take NY
I'll let it happen
I'll pop the cork
tear off the wrappin'
I'll make a splash on the Hudson
that's how I will arrive
Hey, do you have two tens for a five?
Roll out the carpet
Strike up the band
break into the best
champagne when I land
Beat the parade drum
hit all the bars
I want the moon and stars
But I'll take NY
I'll make it happen
Blow out the candlels
tear off the wrappin'
And I know someday
they'll have to name a street after me
right next door to old Franklin D
I'll shoot the moon
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll be the pennies
On your eyes
For you baby
I want to take you
Out to the fair
Here's a red rose
Ribbon for your hair
I'll shoot the moon
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon
A vulture circles
Over your head
For you baby
I'll be the flowers
After you're dead
For you baby
I want to build
A nest in your hair
I want to kiss you
And never be there
I'll shoot the moon
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon
Tonight I'll shave the mountain
I'll cut the hearts from pharoahs
I pull the road off of the rise
tear the memories from my eyes
and in the morning I'll be gone
I drink 1000 shipwrecks
tonight I'll steal your paychecks
I paint the sheets across my bed
the birds will all fly from my head
and in the morning I'll be gone
take every dream that's breathing
find every boot that's leaving
shoot all the lights in the cafe
and in the morning I'll be gone
I bet 1000 dollars
I have a french companion
I tie myself below the deck
I pull the rope around my neck
and in the morning I'll be gone
it takes a life to win her
there is a drum of bourbon
800 pounds of nitro
his boots are thunder as he plays
theree is a stone inside it
tonight his bones will ride it
I'll need a tent to hide it
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone
Well, I wish I was in New Orleans, I can see it in my dreams,
Arminarm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me
Hoist up a few tall cool ones, play some pool and listen
To that tenor saxophone calling me home
And I can hear the band begin "When the Saints Go Marching In",
And by the whiskers on my chin, New Orleans, I'll be there
I'll drink you under the table, be rednosed, go for walks,
The old haunts what I wants is red beans and rice
And wear the dress I like so well, and meet me at the old saloon,
Make sure that there's a Dixie moon, New Orleans, I'll be there
And deal the cards roll the dice, if it ain't that old Chuck E. Weiss,
And Claiborne Avenue, me and you Sam Jones and all
And I wish I was in New Orleans, 'cause I can see it in my dreams,
Arminarm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me
New Orleans, I'll be there
Well, I wish I was in New Orleans

i feel as though we've met before
perhaps i'm mistaken
but it's just that i remind you
of someone you used to care about
but that was long ago
do you think i'd fall for that
i wasn't born yesterday
besides i never talk to strangers anyway
i ain't a bad guy when you get to know me
i just thought there ain't no harm
hey just try minding your own business
bud who asked you to annoy me
with your sad repartee
besides i never talk to strangers anyway
your life's a dimestore novel
this town is full of guys like you
and you're looking for someone to take the place of her
and you're bitter cause he left you
that's why you're drinkin in this bar
well only suckers fall in love
with perfect strangers
it always takes one to know one stranger
maybe we're just wiser now
and been around the block so many times
that we don't notice
that we're all just perfect strangers
as long as we ignore
that we all begin as strangers
just before we find
we really aren't strangers anymore
When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up
Seems like folks turn into things
That they'd never want
The only thing to live for
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wnna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up
Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old Tomb
On Grand Street
When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in and get married then boom
How the hell did I get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up
I don't mind working, 'cause I used to be jerking off most of my time in bars,
I've been a cabbie and a stock clerk and a sodafountain jockjerk
And a manic mechanic on cars.
It's nice work if you can get it, now who the hell said it?
I got money to spend on my gal,
But the work never stops, and I'll be busting my chops
Working for Joe and Sal.
And I can't wait to get off work and see my baby,
She said she'd leave the porch light on for me.
I'm disheveled and I'm disdainful and I'm distracted and it's painful,
But this job sweeping up here is gainfully employing me tonight.
Well "Tom, do this" and "Tom, do that", and "Tom, don't do that",
Count the cash, clean the oven, dump the trash,
Oh your loving is a rare and a copacetic gift,
And I'm a moonlight watch manic, it's hard to be romantic
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine,
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine...
I can't wait to get off work and see my baby
She'll be waiting up with a magazine for me.
Clean the bathrooms and clean 'em good, oh your loving I wish you would
Come down here and sweep ame off my feet, this broom'll have to be my baby,
If I hurry, I just might get off before the dawn's early light.
And See My Baby on Montgomery Avenue
Well I don't mind working

I beg your pardon dear

Of my dreams

He had 3 whole dollars
A worn out car
And a wife who was
LEaving for good
LIfe's made of trouble
Worry pain and struggle
She wrote good bye in
The dust on the hood
THey found a a map of Missouri
Lipstick on the glass
They must of left
In the middle of the nite
And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
Behind a smoke colored
Curtain, the girl
Disappeared, the found out
The ring was a fake
A tree born crooked
Will never grow straight
She sunk like a hammer in to the lake
A long lost letter and
And old leaky boat
Promises are never meant
And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
The barn leaned over
The vultures dried their wings
The moon climbed up an empty sky
The sun sank down behind the tree
On the hill
There's a killer and he's coming
Thru the rye
But maybe he's the Father
Of that lost little girl
It's hard to tell in this light
And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
Drag your wagon and your plow
Over the bones of the dead
Out among the roses and the weeds
You can never go back
And the answer is no
And wishing for it only
Makes it bleed
Joel Tornabene was broken
On the wheel
Shane and Bum Mahoney on the lamb
The grain was as gold
As Sheila's hair
All the way from Liverpool
With all we could steal
He was robbed of twenty dollars
His body found stripped
Cast into the harbour
There and drowned
And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
THe sirens are snaking their
Way up the hill
It's last call somewhere in
The reptiles blend in with the
Color of the street
Life is sweet at the edge
Of a razor
And down in the front row of
An old picture show
The old man is asleep
As the credits start to roll
And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
There's a house on my block
That's abandoned and cold
Folks moved out of it a
Long time ago
And they took all their things
And they never came back
Looks like it's haunted
With the windows all cracked
And everyone call it
The house, the house where
Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
Or did someone do somebody wrong?
Well the paint was all cracked
It was peeled off of the wood
Papers were stacked on the porch
Where I stood
And the weeds had grown up
Just as high as the door
There were birds in the chimney
And an old chest of drawers
Looks like no one will ever
Come back to the
House were nobody lives
Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
Or did someone do someone wrong?
So if you find someone
Someone to have, someone to hold
Don't trade it for silver
Don't trade it for gold
I have all of life's treasures
And they are fine and they are good
They remind me that houses
Are just made of wood
What makes a house grand
Ain't the roof or the doors
If there's love in a house
It's a palace for sure
It ain't nothin but a house
A house where nobody lives
Without love it ain't nothin
But a house, a house where
Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,
Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see,
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
Well the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it,
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
Well the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand,
Well I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette,
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
I can see that you are lonesome just like me, and it being late,
You'd like some some company,
Well I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you's free,
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.
Well I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found,
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you.
They hung a sign up in our town
"if you live it up, you won't
live it down"
So, she left Monte Rio, son
Just like a bullet leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips
She went and took that California trip
Well, the moon was gold, her
Hair like wind
She said don't look back just
Come on Jim
Oh you got to
Hold on, Hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You gotta hold on
Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
And a ring made from a spoon
Everyone is looking for someone to blame
But you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you
Sometimes there's nothin left to do
Oh you got to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you got to
Just hold on.
Well, God bless your crooked little heart St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your brokenchina voice
How I wish you were still here with me
Well, you build it up, you wreck it down
You burn your mansion to the ground
When there's nothing left to keep you here, when
You're falling behind in this
Big blue world
Oh you go to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on
Down by the Riverside motel,
It's 10 below and falling
By a 99 cent store she closed her eyes
And started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way
When it's cold and there's no music
Well your old hometown is so far away
But, inside your head there's a record
That's playing, a song called
Hold on, hold on
You really got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
And just hold on.
Well I learned the trade
From Piggy Knowles
Sing Sing Tommy Shay Boys
God used me as hammer boys
To beat his weary drum today
The sun is up the world is flat
Damn good address for a rat
The smell of blood
The Drone of flies
You know what to do if
The baby cries
Well we stick our fingers in
The ground, heave and
Turn the world around
Smoke is blacking out the sun
At night I pray and clean my gun
The cracked bell rings as
The ghost bird sings and the gods
Go beggin here
So just open fire
As you hit the shore
All is fair in love

Falling James in the Tahoe mud
Stick around to tell us all the tail
He fell in love with a Gun Street Girl and
Now he's dancin' in the Birmingham jail.
Took a 100 dollars off a slaughterhouse Joe
Brought a bran' new michigan 20 gauge
Got all liquored up on that road house corn,
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette.

Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home.
Sitting in a sycamore in St. John's Wood
Soaking' day old bread in kerosene
He was blue as a robin's egg brown as a hog
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tire
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired
Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone
He never got up in the morning on a Saturday
Sittin' by the Erie with a bull whipped dog
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way.
Now the rain's like gravel on old tin roof
And the Burlinton Northern's pullin' out of the world
With a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw.
And a Gun Street Girl was the cause of it all.
Riding in the shadow by the St. Joe Ridge
He heard the click clack tappin' of a blind man's cane
Pullin' into Baker on New Year's Eve
With one eye on the pistol the other on the door,
With one eye on the pistol the other on the door.
Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Row
And the smuggled in a bran' new pair of alligator shoes.
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair, well

Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home.
Bangin' on a table with an old tin cup
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again,
I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again.
Lay your head where my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Come closer don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle 'Didn't He Ramble'
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say...
It smells like rain today
God took the stars and he tossed 'em
Can't tell the birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say good bye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls, mark my words
We'll catch mocking birds
Lay your head where my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me.
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see?
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside,
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide.
Never had no destination, could not get across.
You became my inspiration, oh but what a cost.
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside,
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide.
Now I'm smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity,
And I slip just like the stars into obscurity.
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, puts me up a tree,
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see.
Come on people

When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world.
On October's last, I'll fly back home rolling down winding way
And all I've got's a pocket full of flowers from my grave
But now summer is gone I remember it best
Back in the good old world I remember when, she held my hand
and we walked home alone in the rain how pretty her mouth, how soft
nothing can be the same and there's a rose upon her breast
where I long to lay my head and her hair was so yellow
and the wine was so red Back in the good old world.
Well I'm goin' out west
Where the wind blows tall
'Cause Tony Franciosa
Used to date my ma
They got some money out there
They're giving it away

Little brown sausages

Well my parole officer

With my Olds 88
And the devil on a leash
My Olds 88
And the devil on a leash
Well I kno karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt
Well I don't lose my composure
In a high speed chase
Well my friends think I'm ugly
I got a masculine face
I got some dragstrip courage
I can really drive a bed
I'm gonna change my name
To Hannibal or maybe
Change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex
I'm gonna drive all night
Take some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun
To shine down on me
I cut a hole in my roof
In the shape of a heart
And I'm goin' out west
Where they'll appreciate me
Goin' out west
Goin' out west
Well It's a quarter a two

I'd sell your heart to the junkman baby
For a buck, for a buck
If you're looking for someone
To pull you out of that ditch
You're out of luck, you're out of luck
The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking
There's leak, there's leak,
In the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers
God's away, God's away,
God's away on Business. Business.
God's away, God's away,
God's away on Business. Business.
Digging up the dead with
A shovel and a pick
It's a job, it's a job
Bloody moon rising with
A plague and a flood
Jain the mob, jain the mob
It's all over, it's all over, it's all over
There's a lick, there's a lick,
In the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away,
On Business. Business.
Goddamn ther's always such
A big temptation
To be good, To be good
Tere's always free cheddar in
A mousetrap, baby
It's a deal, it's a deal
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
I narrow my eyes like a coin slot baby,
Let her ring, let her ring

Shovel of dirt upon a coffin lid

Big Jack Earl was 8'1
He stood in the road and he cried
He couldn't make her love him
Couldn't make her stay
But tell the good Lord that he tried
Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville
On the wreck of the Weaverville stage
Beaula fired on Beatty for a lemonade
I was stirring my brandy with a nail boys
Stirring my brandy with a nail
Well the rampaging sons of the widow James
Jack the cutter and the pock marked kid
Had to stand naked at the bottom
Of the cross
And tell the good lord what they did
Tell the good lord what they did
Punctuated birds on the power line
In a Studebaker with the Birdie Joe Joaks
I'm diggin all the way to China
With a silver spoon
While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys
The hangman fumbles with the noose
Pin your ear to the wisdom post
Pin your eye to the line
Never let the weeds get higher
Than the garden
Always keep a sapphire in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
Cold was the night, hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out
On the street.
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for
Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia
From dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she kept runnin away from this world
These children are so hard to raise good
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for
Close your eyes and count to ten
I will got and hid but then
Be sure to find me. I want you to find me
And we'll play all over
We will play all over again
There's a toad in the witch grass
There's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying
For her mom
As the hills turn from green back
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for
Friday left me fumblin' with the blues
And it's hard to win when you always lose
Because the nightspots spend your spirit
Beat your head against the wall
Two dead ends and you've still got to choose
You know the bartenders
They all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a poolshootingshimmyshyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead
You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on
Well they spend your love and then they're gone
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel
Take your love and then they leave on out of town
No they do
Well now fallin' in love is such a breeze
But its standin' up that's so hard for me
I wanna squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back
You know your perfume
Well it won't let me be
You know the bartenders all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a poolshootingshimmyshyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead
Come on baby
Let your love light shine
Gotta bury me inside of your fire
Because your eyes are 'nough to blind me
You're like alooking at the sun
You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
Well Frank settled down in the Valley
and hung his wild years
on a nail that he drove through
his wife's forehead
he sold used office furniture
out there on San Fernando Road
and assumed a 30,000 loan
at 15 14  and put down payment
on a little two bedroom place
his wife was a spent piece of used jet trash
made good bloody marys
kept her mouth shut most of the time
had a little Chihuahua named Carlos
that had some kind of skin disease
and was totally blind. They had a
thoroughly modern kitchen
selfcleaning oven the whole bit
Frank drove a little sedan
they were so happy
One night Frank was on his way home
from work, stopped at the liquor store,
picked up a couple Mickey's Big Mouths
drank 'em in the car on his way
to the Shell station, he got a gallon of
gas in a can, drove home, doused
everything in the house, torched it,
parked across the street, laughing,
watching it burn, all Halloween
orange and chimney red then
Frank put on a top forty station
got on the Hollywood Freeway
Never could stand that dog
Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,
Well the music plays and you display
your heart for me to see,
I had a beer and now I hear you
calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
Well the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown,
take that frown and break it,
Before the evening's gone away,
I think that we could make it,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
Well the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand,
Well I turn around to look at you,
you light a cigarette,
I wish I had the guts to bum one,
but we've never met,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.
I can see that you are lonesome just like me,
and it being late, you'd like some some company,
Well I turn around to look at you,
and you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split,
the chair next to you's free,
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.
Well I turn around to look at you,
you're nowhere to be found,
I search the place for your lost face,
guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you.
Dream away the tears in your eyes
Dream away your sorrows
Dream away all your goodbyes
Dream away tomorrow
I promise when the sun comes up
I promise I'll be true
and just like before the band starts to play
they always play your favorite tune
and dream awawy when everyone's gone
dream away your grey skies tooo
dream away and nothing is wrong
dreams have wishes that are waiting for you
and up ahead the road is turning
turning for you and me
and just like before
the band starts to play
now there's that twinkle in your eye
and dream away
when travelling abroad in the continental style
it's my belief one must attempt to be discreet
and subsequently bear in mind your transient position
allows you a perspective that's unique
though you'll find your itinerary's a blessing and a curse
your wanderlust won't let you settle down
and you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
to stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town
most vagabonds i knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
that remains the object of their long relentless quest
the obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
the pursuit you see and never the arrest
without fear of contradiction bon voyage is always hollered
in conjunction with a handkerchief from shore
by a girl that drives a rambler and furthermore
is overly concerned that she won't see him anymore
planes and trains and boats and buses
characteristically evoke a common attitude of blue
unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
and the cargo that they're carrying is you
a foreign affair juxtaposed with a stateside
and domestically approved romantic fancy
is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances knowing
it will only be parlayed into a memory
Someday the silver moon and I will go to dreamland
I will close my eyes and wake up there in dreamland
And Tell me who will put flowers on a flower's grave?
Who will say a prayer?
Will I meet a China rose there in dreamland?
Or does love lie bleeding in dreamland?
Are these days forever and always?
And if we are to die tonight
Is there a moonlight up ahead?
And if we are to die tonight
Another rose will bloom
For a faded rose
Will I be the one that you save?
I love when it showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave
As one rose blooms and another will die
It's always been that way
I remember the showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave
And if we are to die tonight
Is there a moonlight up ahead?
I remember the showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave
The flash pan hunter sways with the wind
His rifle is the sound of the morning
Each sulfurous bullet way have it's own wit
Each cartridge comes with a warning
Beware of elaborate telescopic meats
They will find their way back to the forest
For Wilhelm can't wait
To be Peg Leg's crown
As the briar is strangling
The rose back down
His back shall be my slender new branch
It will sway and bend in the breeze
As the devil does his polka
Wit ha hatchet in his hand
As a sniper in the branches of the trees
As the vulture flutters down
As the snake sheds his dove
Wilhelm's cutting off his fingers
So they'll fit into his glove
They bought a round for the sailor
And they heard his tale
Of a world that was so far away
And a song that we'd never heard
A song of a little bird
That fell in love with a whale
He said, 'You cannot live in the ocean'
And she said to him
'You never can live in the sky'
But the ocean is filled with tears
And the sea turns into a mirror
There's a whale in the moon when it's clear
And a bird on the tide
Please don't cry
Let me dry your eyes
So tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend you're mine
Though I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart
Please don't cry
Let me dry your eyes
And tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend that you're mine
I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart
Well I hung on to Mary's stump
I danced with a soldier's glee
With a rum soaked crook
And a big fat laugh
I spent my last dollar on thee
I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell
Kehoe spiked the nog
With a chain link fence
And a scrap iron jaw
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog
Spider rolled in from
With a oneeyed stolen Mare
Donned himself with chicken fat
Sawin on a jaw bone violin there
Kathleen was sittin down
In little reds recovery room
In her criminal underwear bra
I was naked to the waist
With my fierce black hound
And I'm cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road
Fill it with madrone and bay
Stinks like hell
And the neighbors complain
Don't give a hoot what they say
Slap that hog
Gotta roll em over twice
Baste him with a sweeping broom
You gotta swat them flies
And chain up the dogs
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs
Old brown Betty with a yellow wig
Tain't the mince meat filagree
And it ain't the turkey neck stew
And it ain't them bruleed
Okra seeds though she
Made them especially for you
Worse won a prize for her
Bottom black pie
The beans got to thrown to the dogs
Jaheseus Christ I can always
Make room when they're
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
I have come 500 miles just to see a halo
Come from St. Petersburg, Scarlett and me
Well I open my eyes, I was blind as can be
When you give a man luck, he must fall in the sea
And she wants you to steal and get caught
For she loves you for all that you are not
When you're falling down, falling down
When you're falling down, falling down, falling down
You forget all the roses, don't come around on Sunday
She's not gonna choose you for standing so tall
Go on and take a swig of that poison and like it
And don't ask for silverware, don't ask for nothing
Go on and put your ear to the ground
You know you will be hearing that sound......falling down.
You're falling down, falling down
Falling down, Falling down, falling down
When you're falling down, falling down, falling down
Go on down and see that wrecking ball come swinging on along
Everyone knew that hotel was a goner
They broke all the windows, they took all the door knobs
And they hauled it away in a couple of days
Now someone yell timber and take off your hat
It's a lot smaller down here on the ground
You're falling down, falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down, falling down
Someone's falling down, falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down, falling down
Well Zenora Bariella
And Coriander Pyle
They had sixteen children
In the usual style
They had a curio museum
And they had no guile
All they ever wanted
Was a show biz child
So on the 7th of Dec. 1949
They got what
They'd been wishing for
All of the time
He grew up in a trailer
By the time he was 9
He rolled off to join
The circus... telling fortunes
On the side
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Well the first time I saw him
Was a Saigon jail
Cost me 27 dollars
Just to go his bail
I said your name will
Be in lights...
And that's no doubt
But you got to have
A manager that's what
It's all about
People would point
People would stare
I'll always be here
To protect you and to
Cut down on the glare
I know you can't speak
I know you can't sign
So cry right here on
The dotted line
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Well he was born with out a body
Not even a brow
I made the kid a promise
I made the kid a vow
He's not conventionally handsome
He'll never be tall
He said "all you got to do is
Book me into Carnegie Hall"
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
He's just a little bitty thing
He's just a little guy
But women go crazy
For the big blue eye
They say how does he
Dream? How does he think
When he can't ever speak
And he can't ever blink?
I said Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Give it up and throw me down
A couple of quic
Everybody wants to see
The Eyeball kid
How dies he dream
How does he think
When he can't even speak
And he can't even blink
We are all lost in the
Wilderness we're as
Blind as can be
He came down to teach us
How to really see
So give it up and throw
Me down a couple of quid
Everybody wants to see
The Eyeball kid
Everything you can think of is true
Before the ocean was blue
We were lost in a flood
Run red with your blood
Nigerian skeleton crew
Everything you can think of is true
The dish ran away with the spoon
Dig deep in your heart for that little red glow
We’re decomposing as we go
Everything you can think of is true
And fishes make wishes on you
We’re fighting our way up dreamland’s spine
Red flamingos and expensive wine
Everything you can think of is true
The baby’s asleep in your shoe
Your teeth are buildings with yellow doors
Your eyes are fish on a creamy shore
Why be sweet, why be careful, why he kind?
A man has only one thing on his mind
Why ask palitely, why go lightly,
Why say please?
They only want to get you on your knees
There are a few things I never could believe
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven
When you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...
Laissezfaire mi amour, ce la vie
Shall I return to shore or swim
Back out to sea?
The world don't care what a soldier
Does in town
It's all hanging in the windows
By the pound
There are few things
I never could believe...
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven
When you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...
I only want to hear your purr and to hear
Ou moan There is another man who brings
The money home
I don't want dishes in the sink
Please don't tell me what you
Feel of what you think
There are few things I never could believe...
late night and early morning low clouds
with a chance of fog
chance of showers into the afternoon
with variable high cloudiness
and gusty winds, gusty winds
at times around the corner of
Sunset and Alvorado
things are tough all over
when the thunder storms start
increasing over the southeast
and south central portions
of my apartment, I get upset
and a line of thunderstorms was
developing in the early morning
ahead of a slow moving coldfront
with tornado watches issued shortly
before noon Sunday, for the areas
including, the western region
of my mental health
and the northern portions of my
ability to deal rationally with my
disconcerted precarious emotional
situation, it's cold out there
colder than a ticket taker's smile
at the Ivar Theatre, on a Saturday night
flash flood watches covered the
southern portion of my disposition
there was no severe weather well
into the afternoon, except for a lone gust of
wind in the bedroom
in a high pressure zone, covering the eastern
portion of a small suburban community
with a 103 and millibar high pressure zone
and a weak pressure ridge extending from
my eyes down to my cheeks cause since
you left me baby
and put the vice grips on my mental health
well the extended outlook for an
indefinite period of time until you
come back to me baby is high tonight
low tomorrow, and precipitation is
nighthawks at the diner
of Emma's 49er, there's a rendezvous
of strangers around the coffee urn tonight
all the gypsy hacks, the insomniacs
now the paper's been read
now the waitress said
eggs and sausage and a side of toast
coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
what kind of pie?
In a graveyard charade, a late shift masquerade
2 for a quarter, dime for a dance
with Woolworth rhinestone diamond
earrings, and a sideway's glance
and now the register rings
and now the waitress sings
the classified section offered no direction
it's a cold caffeine in a nicotine cloud
now the touch of your fingers
lingers burning in my memory
I've been 86ed from your scheme
I'm in a melodramatic nocturnal scene
I'm a refugee from a disconcerted affair
as the lead pipe morning falls
and the waitress calls

and the waitress calls
Rudy's on the midway
And Jacob's in the hole
THe monkey's on the ladder
The devil shovels coal
With crows as big as airplanes
The lion has three heads
And someone will eat the skind that he sheds
ANd the earth died screaming
The earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
Well hell doesn't want you
And heaven is full
Bring me some water
Put it in this skull
I walk between the raindrops
Wait in Bug House Square
And the army ants
They leave nothin' but the bones
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
There was thunder
There was lightning
Then the stars went out
And the moon fell from the sky
It rained mackerel
It rained trout
And the great day of wrath has come
And here's mud in your big red eye
The poker's in the fire
And the locusts take the sky
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
Tightslacked clad girls on the graveyard shift
'Neath the cement stroll
Catch the midnight drift
Cigar chewing charlie
In that newspaper nest
grifting hot horse tips
On who's running the best
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
And the moon's a silver slipper
It's pouring champagne stars
Broadway's like a serpent
Pulling shiny topdown cars
Laramer is teeming
With that undulating beat
And some Bonneville is screaming
It's way wilder down the street
Hearts flutter and race
The moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes
The night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers
As a Clevelandbound Greyhound
And it cuts throught the night
And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down the street
Shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now
I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Where every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All of my dreams just fall like rain
All upon a downtown train
red pants and the sugarman in, the temple street gloom, drinkin' chivas
regal in a four dollar room, just another dead soldier in a powder blue night,
sugarman says baby everything's alright, goin' downtown down downtown.
montclaire de havelin doin' the st. vitus dance, lookin' for someone to chop
the lumber in his pants, how am i gonna unload all of this ice and all this
mink, all the traffic in the street but it's so hard to think, goin' downtown
frankie's wearin' lipstick pierre cardin, i swear to god i seen him holdin'
hands with jimmy bond, sally's high on crank and hungry for some sweets, she's
fem in the sheets but she's butch in the streets, goin' downtown down

arms i want to push you around, i want to break your bottle and spill out all
your charms, come on baby we'll set off all the burglar alarms, goin' downtown
red pants and the sugarman in the temple, drinkin' chivas regal in a four
dollar room, just another dead soldier in a powder blue night, red pants turns
to sugarman and says everything's alright, goin' downtown down downtown.
He went down down down
and the devil called him by name
he went down down down
hangin' onto the back of a train
he went down down down
this boy went solid down
always chewed tobacco
and the bathtub gin
always chewed tobacco
and the bathtub gin
he went down down down
this boy went solid down
he went down
Well he went down down down
and the jumped on his head
he went down down down
stayin' in a broken down shed
he went down down down
sleepin' in the devil's bed
he went down down down
never listened to the words I said
he went down down down down
he went down
Well he went down down down
and the devil said where you been
he went down down down
he screamin' down around the bend
down down down
this boy went solid down
He was always cheatin'
and he always told lies
he was always cheatin'
and he always told lies
he went down down down
down down down
this boy went solid down
he went down
Black cellophane sky at midnite
Big blue moon with three gold rings
I called Champion to the window
And I pointed up above the trees
That's where I heard my name in a scream
Coming from the woods, out there
I let my dog run off the chain
I locked my door real good with a chair
Everett Lee broke loose again
Its worse than the time before
Cause he's high on potato and tulip wine
Fermented in the muddy rain of course
A drunken wail a drunk train
Blew through the birdless trees
Oh, you're alone alright
Your alone alright
An old black tree
Scratching up the sky
With boney, claw like fingers
A rusty black rake
Digging up the turnips
Of a muddy cold grey day
Shiny tooth talons
Coiled for grabbing a stranger
And the day when home early
And the sun sank down into
The much of a deep dead sky
Bank since Saginaw Calinda was born
It's been cotton, soybeans, tobacco and corn
Behind the porticoed house of a
Long dead farm
They found the falling down timbers
Of a spooky old barn
Out there like a slave ship
Wrecked beneath the waves of a rain
When the river is low
They find old bones and
When they plow they always
Dig up chains
Did you bury your fire?
Did you cover your tracks?
Did you bring your knife?
Did they see your face?
Did the Mom see you?
DId you go cross the river?
Did you fix your rake?
Did you stay down wind?
Did you hide your gun?
Did you smuggle your rum?
Don't forget that I warned you
No shirt no coat
Put me on a flat boat
Dover, down to Covington
Covington to Louisville
Louisville to Henderson
Henderson to Smithland
Smithland to Memphis
Down to Vicksburg to
Natchez put me on a
Flat boat Dover Dam
To Covington, Covington to
Louisville, Louisville to

What does it matter, a dream of love
Or a dream of lies
We're all gonna be in the same place
When we die
Your spirit don't leave knowing
Your face or your name
And the wind through your bones
Is all that remains
And we're all gonna be
We're all gonna be
Just dirt in the ground
The quill from a buzzard
The blood writes the word
I want to know am I the sky
Or a bird
'Cause hell is boiling over
And heaven is full
We're chained to the world
And we all gotta pull
And we're all gonna be
Just dirt in the ground
Now the killer was smiling
With nerves made of stone
He climbed the stairs
And the gallows groaned
And the people's hearts were pounding
They were throbbing, they were red
As he swung out ofver the crowd
I heard the hangman said
We're all gonna be
Just dirt in the ground
Now Cain slew Abel
He killed him with a stone
The sky cracked open
And the thunder groaned
Along a river of flesh
Can these dry bones live?
Ask a king or a beggar
And the answer they'll give
Is we're all gonna be
We're all gonna be just
Dirt in the ground

Well these diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying
It always makes me sing
There's a Duster tryin' to change my tune
He's pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly by a twentyfour hour moon
And a Wisconsin hiker with a cueball head
He's wishing he was home in a Wiscosin bed
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the East
Colder then a welldigger's ass
And it's colder than a welldigger's ass
Oceanside it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up
Those Sunday desperadoes slip by and cruise with a dry back
And the orange drivein the neon billin'
And the theatre's fillin' to the brim
With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin
Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Flybynights from Riverside
And out of state plates running a little late
But the sailors jockey for the fast lane
So 101 don't miss it
There's rolling hills and concrete fields
And the broken line's on your mind
The eights go east and the fives go north
And the merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line, signalling with a blink
And the radio's gone off the air
Gives you time to think
And you hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
And blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
And one more block the engine talks
Whispers 'home at last'
It whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
It whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
And there are diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got me a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
Late nights and freeway flying
Always makes me sing
It always makes me sing
Hey look here Jack, ok
Well these diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying
It always makes me sing

Hey look here Jack, ok
Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
I ain't coming, I ain't going
My confusion is showing
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue
I'm gonna paint myself blue
At the depot
I watch the taxis pull up and idle
I can't claim title to a single memory
He offered me a key
'Cause opportunity don't knock
He has no tongue and she cannot talk
You're gonna shuffle when you walk
At the depot
This peepingTom needs a peephole
And an uptempo song
To move me along
When I find this depot baby
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue
Oh, tell me what a poor boy to do
At the depot
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
She was a middle class girl
She was in over her head
She thought she would
Stand up in the deep end
He had a bullet proof smile
He had money to burn
She thought she had the moon
In her pocket
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and lovely now
I've always been told to
Don't let a fool kiss you
Never marry for love
He was hard to impress
He knew everyone's secrets
He wore her on his arm
Just like jewelry
He never gave but he got
He kept her on a leash
He's not the kind of wheel
You fall asleep at
But now she's dead
Forever dead and lovely now
Come closer, look deeper
You've fallen fast
Just like a plane on a
She made up someone to be
She made up somewhere to be from
This is one business in the
World where that's no
Problem at all
Everything that is left
They will only plow under
Soon every one you know
Will be gone
And now she's dead
Forever dead and lovely now
Now she's dead
Forever dead and lovely now
I've always been told to
Don't let a kiss fool you
Never marry for love
What's more romantic
Then dying in the moonlight?
Now they're all watching the sea
What's lost can never be broken
Her roots were sweet
But they were so shallow
And now she's dead
Forever dead and lovely now
And now she's dead
And she's so dead and lovely now
I got your letter today
And I miss you all so much, here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days, dear
I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world
And I'll come home
On the day after tomorrow
It is so hard
And it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border
But I miss you won't believe
Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch tomorrow
On the day after tomorrow
I close my eyes
And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies
About what it means to be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel
About all the blood that's been spilled
Look out on the street
Get me back home
On the day after tomorrow
You can't deny
The other side
Don't want to die
Any more than we do
What I'm trying to say,
Is don't they pray
To the same God that we do?
Tell me, how does God choose?
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel?
And who throws the dice
On the day after tomorrow?
I'm not fighting
I am not fighting
I am fighting
For my life
And another day
In the world here
I just do what I've been told
You're just the gravel on the road
And the one's that are lucky
One's come home
On the day after tomorrow
And the summer
It too will fade
And with it comes the winter's frost, dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost here
I'll be twentyone today
I've been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
And my plane it will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
Now, George was a good straight boy to begin with, but there was bad
In him someway he got into the magic bullets and that leads straight to
Devil's work, just like marijuana leads to heroin you think yo ucan take
Them bullets or leave 'em, do you?
Just save a few for your bad days
Well, now, we all have those bad days when you can't shoot for shit.
The more of them magics you use, the more bad days you have without
So it comes down finally to all your days being bad without the bullets
It's magics or nothing
Time to stop chippying around and kidding yourself,
Kid, you're hooked, heavy as lead
And that's where old George found himself
Out there at the crossroads
Molding the Devil's bullets
Now a man figures it's his bullets, so it will
Hit what he wants to hit
But it don't always work that way
You see, some bullets is special for a single aim
A certain stag, or a certain person
And no matter where you are, that's where the bullet will end up
And in the moment of aiming, the gun turns into a dowser's wand
And point where the bullet wants to go
George Schmid was moving in a series of convulsive spasms, like
with an epileptic fit, with his face distorted and his eyes wild like a
lassoed horse bracing his legs. But something kept pulling him on. And
he is picking up the skulls and making the circle.
I guess old George didn't rightly know what he's getting himself into
The fit was on him and it carried him right to the crossroads
Every night she cames
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest
Man in the town
She's a rose, she's the pearl
She's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
She's a princess, in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
Well the moon is broken
And the sky is cracked
Come on up to the house
The only things that you can see
Is all that you lack
Come on up to the house
All your cryin don't do no good
Come on up to the house
Come down off the cross
We can use the wood
Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a passin thru
Come on up to the house
There's no light in the tunnel
No irons in the fire
Come on up to the house
And your singin lead soprano
In a junkman's choir
You gotta come on up to the house
Does life seem nasty, brutish and short
Come on up to the house
The seas are stormy
And you can't find no port
Come on up to the house
There's nothin in the world
there's nothin in the world
that you can do
you gotta come on up to the house
and you been whipped by the forces
that are inside you
come on up to the house
well you're high on top
of your mountain of woe
come on up to the house
well you know you should surrender
but you can't let go
you gotta come on up to the house
Well I woke up this morning
With the cold water

With the cold water
Woke up this morning
With the cold water

Police at the station
And they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly
Police at the station
And they don't look friendly
They don't look friendly well
Blind or crippled
Sharp or dull
I'm reading the Bible
By a 40 watt bulb
What price freedom
Dirt is my rug
Well I sleep like a baby
With the snakes and the bugs
Well the stores are open
But I ain't got no money
I ain't got no money
Stores are open but I
Ain't got no money
Ain't got no money

Found an old dog and he
Seems to like me
Seems to like me
Well he seems

Scrapin up a little 
To buy a bottle of wine
Pregnant women and
The Vietnam vets I say
Beggin on the freeway
Bout as hard as it gets
Well I slept in the graveyard
It was cool and still
Cool and still
It was cool and still
Slept in the graveyard
It was cool and still
Cool and still and it
Slept all night in the Cedar grove
I was born to ramble
Born to rove
Some men are searchin for the
But there ain't nothin sweeter
Than ridin the rails
I love 47 but I'm 24
Well they shooed me away
From here the time before
Turned there their backs
And they locked their doors
I'm watching T.V. in
The window of a furniture store
Well I woke up this morning
With the cold water
With the cold water
With the cold water
Woke up this morning
With the cold water
With the cold water
With the cold
Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafe
never slept with a dream before he had to go away
there's a bell in the tower
Uncle Ray bought a round
don't worry about the army
in the cold cold ground
now don't be a cry baby
when there's wood in the shed
there's a bird in the chimmney
and a stone in my bed
when the road's washed out
they pass the bottle around
and wait in the arms
of the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
there's a ribbon in the willow
and a tire swing rope
and a briar patch of berries
takin over the slope
the cat'll sleep in the mailbox
and we'll never go to town
til we bury every dream in
the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
gimme a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
blow the roof off the goat barn
let it roll down the hill
the piano is firewood
times square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
cold cold ground
call the cops on the Breedloves
bring a bible and a rope
and a whole box of rebel
and a bar of soap
make a pile of trunk tires
and burn 'em all down
bring a dollar with you baby
in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
take a weathervane rooster
throw rocks at his head
stop talking to the neighbors
til we all go dead
beware of my temper
and the dog that I've found
break all the windows in the
cold cold ground
cold cold ground
Sane, sane they're all insane
The fireman's blind, the conductors lame
A Cincinatti jacket and a sad luck dame
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain
Clap hands, Clap hands
Clap hands, Clap hands
Said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
Moon in the window a bird on the pole
Can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands, Clap hands
Clap hands, Clap hands
Steam, steam a hundred bad dreams
Goin' up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty dollar bill inside in Palladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at
Shine, shine a Roosevelt dime
All the way to Baltimore and runnin' out of time
Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole
They all went to Heaven in the little row boat
Clap hands, Clap hands
Clap hands, Clap hands
Well my baby's so fine
Even her car looks good
Well my baby's so fine
Even her car looks good
But the train that took
It went clang, boom and steam
We put up our tent on a dark
Green knoll, outside of town by
The train tracks and a seagull dump
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel
And her 'Marvellous Pigs In Satin'
We pounded our stakes in the ground
All powder brown
And the branches spread like scary
We were in a pasture outside Kankakee
And One Eyed Myra, the queen of
The galley who trained the
Ostrich and the camels
She looked at me squinty with her
One good eye in a Roy Orbison
Tshirt as she bottle fed
An orangutan named Tripod
And then there was
Yodeling Elaine the
Queen of the air who wore a
Dollar sign medallion and she
Had a tiny bubble of spittle
Around her nostril and a
Little rusty tear, for she had
Lassoed and lost another
And over in
The burnt yellow tent
By the frozen tractor, the
Music was like electric sugar
And Zuzu Bolin played
'Stavin' Chain' and Mighty
Tiny on the saw and he
Threw his head back with a
Mouth full of gold teeth
And they played 'Lopsided heart'
And 'Moon over Dog Street'
And by the time they played "Moanin Low"
I was soakin' wet and wild eyed
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a
Preparation and I fell asleep with
'Livery Stable Blues' in my ear
And me and Molley Hoey drank
Pruno and Koolaid and she had a
Tattoo gun made out of a cassette
Motor and a guitar string and
She soaked a hanky in 3 Roses
And rubbed it on the spot
And drew a rickety heart and
A bent arrow and it hurt like hell
And Funeral Wells spun
Poodle Murphy on the target
As he threw his hardware,
Only once in Sheboygan did he miss
At a matinee on Diamond Pier and
She'd never let him forget it
They were doing two shows and she
Had a high fever and he took
Off a piece of her ear and
Tip Little told her she should
Leave the bum
But Poodle said, "He fetched me
Last time I run."
But I'd like to hammer this ring into a bullet
And I wish I had some whiskey and a gun
And I wish I had some whiskey and a gun
hey Charley I'm pregnant
and living on 9th street
right above a dirty bookstore
off cuclid avenue
and I stopped taking dope
and I quit drinking whiskey
and my old man plays the trombone
and works out at the track.
and he says that he loves me
even though its not his baby
and he says that he'll raise him up
like he would his own son
and he gave me a ring
that was worn by his mother
and he takes me out dancin
every saturday nite.
and hey Charley I think about you
everytime I pass a fillin' station
on account of all the grease
you used to wear in your hair
and I still have that record
of little anthony  the imperials
but someone stole my record player
how do you like that?
hey Charley I almost went crazy
after mario got busted
so I went back to omaha to
live with my folks
but everyone I used to know
was either dead or in prison
so I came back in minneapolis
this time I think I'm gonna stay.
hey Charley I think I'm happy
for the first time since my accident
and I wish I had all the money
that we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot
and I wouldn't sell any of em
I'd just drive a different car
every day dependin on how
do you want to know
the truth of it?
I don't have a husband
he don't play the trombone
and I need to borrow money
to pay this lawyer
and Charley, hey
I'll be eligible for parole
come valentines day.
Don't go to church on Sunday
Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the Bible
I got my own special way
Bit I know Jesus loves me
Maybe just a little bit more
I fall on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee's candy store
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied
Well I don't want no Anna Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better
Suitable for this boy
Well it's the only thing
That can pick me up
Better than a cup of gold
See only a chocolate Jesus
Can satisfy my soul
When the weather gets rough
And it's whiskey in the shade
It's best to wrap your savior
Up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy
But that's ok
Pour him over ice cream
For a nice parfait
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Good enough for me
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Good enough for me
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied
Independent as a
Hog on ice
Hi's a big shot down there
At the slaughterhouse
He plays accordion
Uncle Biltmore and
World War II
But they're tightwads
And they'll never
Give a dime to you
She lives in
The doorway of an old hotel
Radio's playing opera and
All she ever says
Is go to Hell.
Flew as a pilot
He said there
Ain't no pretty
Girls in France
Now he runs a
Bookie joint they say
Keeps it in his pants
Will never leave a will
And the tumor is as
Big as an egg
He has a mistress
She's Puerto Rican
And i heard she has
A wooden leg.
Can't live without his pills
He has emphysema and
He's almost blind
And we must find out
Where the money is
Get it now
Before he loses his min
California, Here I Come
written by Joseph Meyer, Al Jolson and Buddy G. De Sylva
jack was sittin poker faced with bullets backed with bitches
neal hunched at the wheel puttin everyone in stiches
braggin bout this nurse he screwed while drivin through nebraska
and when she came she honked the horn and neal just barely missed a
truck and then he asked her if she'd like to come like that to californy
see a red head in a uniform will always get you horny
with her hairnet and those white shoes and a name tag and a hat
she drove like andy granatelli and knew how to fix a flat
and jack was almost at the bottom of his md 2020 neal was yellin
out the window tryin to buy some bennies from a lincoln
full of mexicans whose left rear tire blowed and the sonsobitches
prit near almost ran off the road
well the nurse had spilled the manoshevitz all up and down her dress
then she lit the map on fire neal just had to guess
should we try and find a bootleg route or a fillin station open
the nurse was dumpin out her purse lookin for an envelope and
jack was out of cigarettes we crossed the yellow line
the gas pumps looked like tombstones from here
felt lonelier than a parking lot when the last car pulls away
and the moonlight dressed the double breasted foothills
in the mirror weaving outa negligee and a black brassiere
the mercury was runnin hot and almost out of gas
just then florence nightingale dropped her drawers and
stuck her fat ass half way out of the window with a
wilson pickett tune
and shouted get a load of this and gave the finger to the moon
countin one eyed jacks and whistling dixie in the car
neal was doin least a hundred when we saw a fallin star
florence wished that neal would hold her stead of chewin
his cigar jack was noddin out and dreamin he was in a bar
with charlie parker on the bandstand not a worry in the world
and a glass of beer in one hand and his arm around a girl
and neal was singin to the nurse
underneath a harlem moon
and somehow you could just tell we'd be in california soon
licorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue scrawled across the shoulders
of a dying town the one eyed jacks across the railroad tracks
and the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through
he was a juvenile delinquent never learned how to behave
but the cops would never think to look in
and the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone
he didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known
he kinda looked like farley granger with his hair slicked back
she says i'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat
how far are you going he said depends on what you mean
he says i'm going thataway just as long as it's paved
i guess you'd say i'm on my way to
and her knees up on the glove compartment
took out her barrettes and her hair spilled out like rootbeer
and she popped her gum and arched her back
hell marysville ain't nothing but a wide spot in the road
some night my heart pounds just like thunder
i don't know why it don't explode
cause everyone in this stinking town has got one foot in the grave
and i'd rather take my chances out in
presley's what i go by why don't you change the station
count the grain elevators in the rearview mirror
mister anywhere you point this thing
has got to beat the hell out of the sting
of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin
and so drill me a hole with a barber pole
i'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight
why don't you have another swig
and pass that car if you're so brave
i wanna get there before the sun comes up in
and the spider web crack and the mustang screamed
smoke from the tires and the twisted machine
just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved
lie swindled from them on the way to
and the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow
up against the car door on the shot gun side
and when they pulled her from the wreck you know she
still had on her shades
they say that dreams are growing wild just this side of
Old busted chains,
With busted handle bars
Out in the rain.
Have an orphanage for
All these things that nobody
Wants any more
September's reminding July
It's time to be saying goodbye.
Summer is gone,
Our love will remain.
Like old broken bicycles
Out in the rain.
Don't tell my folks
There's all those playing cards
Pinned to the spokes,
Laid down like skeletons
out on the lawn.
The wheels won't turn
When the other has gone.
The seasons can turn on a dime,
Somehow I forget every time
For all the things that you've given me
Will always stay
Broken, but I'll never throw them away
My daddy told me, lookin' back
The best friend you'll have is a railroad track
So when I was 13 said, I'm rollin' my own,
And I'm leavin' Missouri and I'm never comin' home
And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Satchel Puddin' and Lord God Mose
Sitting by the fire with a busted nose
That fresh egg yeller is too damn rare
But the white part is perfect for slickin' down your hair
And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain
The moon's the color of a coffee stain
Jesse Frank and Birdy Joe Hoaks
But who is the king of all these folks?
And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Well I dined last night with Scarface Ron
On telapia fish cakes and fried black swan
Razorweed onion and peacock squirell
And I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl
And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Well, god's green hair is where I slept last
He balanced a diamond on a blade of grass
Now I woke me up with a cardinal bird
And when I wanna talk he hangs on every word
And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
She sends me blue valentines
all the way from philadelphia
to mark the anniversary
of someone that I used to be
and it feels just like there's
a warrant out for my arrest
got me checkin' in my rearview mirrror
and I'm always on the run
thats why I change my name
and I didn't think you'd ever find me here
to send me blue valentines
like half forgotten dreams
like a pebble in my shoe
as I walk these streets
and the ghost of your memory
is the thistle in the kiss
and the burgler that that can break a roses neck
it's the tattooed broken promise
that I hide beneath my sleeve
and I see you every time I turn my back
she sends me blue valentines
though I try to remain at large
they're insisting that our love
must have a culogy
why do I save all of this madness
in the nightstand drawer
there to haunt upon my shoulders
baby I know
I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
with a blind and broken heart
that sleeps beneath my lapel
she sends me blue valentines
to remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt
or get these bloodstains off my hands
and it takes a lot of whiskey
to make these nightmares go away
and I cut my bleedin' heart out every nite
and I die a little more on each st. valentine day
remember that I promised I would
these blue valentines
Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in
the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
quiet as a church mouose
She found Raleigh's on
Sugar daddy caught a polocar
Ain't no solitary
tap dance way down here
I swear I's riding
on a field mouse
we were dancin' in the slaughterhouse
If you swing along the beltway
then you skid along the all day
cause I went a little crazy
and I sat upon a high chair
And I'm smokin like a diesel
way out here
Blow wind blow  blow me away here 
blow wind blow repeat
Take an eye for an eye
Take a tooth for a tooth
Just like they say in the Bible
Never leave a trace or forget a face
Of any man at the table
When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger
Sharp enough to draw blood from a stone
He rides through your dreams on a coach
And horses and the fence posts
In the midnight look like bones
Well they've stopped trying to hold him
With mortar, stone and chain
He broke out of every prison
Boots mount the staircase
The door is flung back open
He's not there for he has risen
He's not there for he has risen
Well he once killed a man with a guitar string
He's been seen at the table with kings
Well he once saved a baby from drowning
There are those who say beneath his coat there are wings
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
He can turn himself into a stranger
Wel lthey broke a lot of canes on his hide
he was born away in a cornfield
A fever beats in his head like a drum inside
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
She lives in a house
That's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern
And he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed
A skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through
In this sinking board walk town
She's my Black Market Baby
She's my Black Market Baby
She's a diamond that
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
I swang out wide with her
On hells iron gate
Anything that you wanted
You could have
My eyes say their prayers to her
Sailors ring her bell
Like a moth mistakes a light bulb
For the moon and goes to hell
She's my Black Market Baby
She's my Black Market Baby
She's a diamond that
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
There's no prayer like desire
There's amnesia in her kiss
She's a swan and a pistol
And she will follow you like this
In Moverly, Missouri at the
She checked in with the President
And she ran up quite a Bill
She's whiskey in a teacup
She gives blondes a lousy name
She's a Bonzai Aphrodite
And a ticket back to Spain
She's a hard way to go
And there ain't no way
Every time you play the red
The black is coming up
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
Well you see I happened to be back on the east coast
A few years back tryin? to make me a buck
Like everybody else, well you know
Times get hard and well I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roamin? and bummin?
Around, so I started thumbin? my way
Back to my old hometown
You know I made quite a few miles
In the first couple of days, and i
Figured I'd be home in a week if my
Luck held out this way
But you know it was the third night
I got stranded, it was out at a cold lonely
Crossroads, and as the rain came
Pouring down, I was hungry, tired
Freezin?, caught myself a chill, but
It was just about that time that
The lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should of seen me smile when i
Heard them air brakes come on, and
I climbed up in that cab where i
Knew it'd be warm at the wheel
Well at the wheel sat a big man
I'd have to say he must of weighed 210
The way he stuck out a big hand and
Said with a grin ?big joe's the name
And this here rig's called phantom 309?
Well I asked him why he called his
Rig such a name, but he just turned to me
And said ?why son don't you know this here
Rig'll be puttin? ?em all to shame, why
There ain't a driver on this
Or any other line for that matter
That's seen nothin? but the taillights of big joe
And phantom 309?
So we rode and talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and joe told his and
I smoked up all his viceroys as we rolled along
He pushed her ahead with 10 forward gears
Man that dashboard was lit like the old
Madam la rue pinball, a serious semi truck
Until almost mysteriously, well it was the
Lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me and said ?i'm sorry son
But I'm afraid this is just as far as you go
You see I kinda gotta be makin? a turn
Just up the road a piece,? but I'll be
Damned if he didn't throw me a dime as he
Threw her in low and said ?go on in there
Son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee
On big joe?
And when joe and his rig pulled off into
The night, man in nothing flat they was
Clean outa sight
So I walked into the old stop and
Ordered me up a cup of mud sayin?
?big joe's settin? this dude up? but
It got so deathly quiet in that
Place, you could of heard a pin drop
As the waiter's face turned kinda
Pale, I said ?what's the matter did
I say somethin? wrong? ? I kinda
Said with 8a half way grin. he said
?no son, you see it'll happen every
Now and then. you see every driver in
Here knows big joe, but let me
Tell you what happened just 10 years
Ago, yea it was 10 years ago
Out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Where you flagged joe down, and
There was a whole bus load of kids
And they were just comin? from school
And they were right in the middle when
Joe topped the hill, and could
Have been slaughtered except
Joe turned his wheels, and
He jacknifed, and went
Into a skid, and folks around here
Say he gave his life to save that bunch
Of kids, and out there at that cold
Lonely crossroads, well they say it
Was the end of the line for
Big joe and phantom 309, but it's
Funny you know, cause every now and then
Yea every now and then, when the
Moon's holdin? water, they say old joe
Will stop and give you a ride, and
Just like you, some hitchhiker will be
?so here son,? he said to me, ?get
Yourself another cup of coffee, it's on the
House, you see I want you to hang on
To that dime, yea you hang on to that
Dime as a kind of souvenir, a
Souvenir of big joe and phantom 309?

I got the clothes but not the face

Cuttin' through the cane break
Ratting the sill
Thunder that the rain makes
When the shadow tops the hill
Big light on the back street
Hill to ever more, Packin' down the ladder
With hammer to the floor
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford.
Well he's all boxed up
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with
A blind man's cane
A yellow bullet with a
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger
Get an old bell Jim
Here comes the Big Black
Mariah, Here comes the Big Black
Mariah, Here comes the Big Black
Mariah, Here comes the Big Black Ford.
Sent to the skies on a

With the old widow Jones...
He's got a wooden coat this boy
Is never coming home
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford.
Cut through the
all my friends are married
every Tom and Dick and Harry
you must be strong
to go it alone
here's to the bachelors
and the bowery bums
and those who feel that they're the ones
who are better off without a wife
I like to sleep until the crack of noon
midnight howlin' at the moon
goin' out when I wanto, comin' home when I please
I don't have to ask permission
if I want to go out fishing
and I never have to ask for the keys
never been no Valentino
had a girl who lived in Reno
left me for a trumpet player
didn't get me down
he was wanted for assault
though he said it weren't his fault
well the coppers rode him right
out of town
selfish about my privacy
as long as I can be with me
we get along so well I can't believe
I love to chew the fat with folks
and listen to all your dirty jokes
I'm so thankful for these friends
I do receive
A cloud lets go of the moon
Her ribbons are all out of tune
She is skating on the ice
In a glass in the hands of a man
That she kissed on a train
And the children are all gone into town
To get candy and we are alone in the house here
And your eyes fall down on me
And I belong only to you
The water is filling my shoes
In the wine of my heart there's a stone
In a well made of bone
That you bring to the pond
And I'm here in your pocket
Curled up in a dollar
And the chain from your watch around my neck
And I'll stay right here until it's time
The girls all knit in the shade
Before the baby is made
And the branches bend down
To the ground here to swing on
I'm lost in the blond summer grass
And the train whistle blows
And the carnival goes
Till there's only the tickets and crows here
And the grass will all grow back
And the branches spell 'Alice'
And I belong only to you

When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world.
On October's last I'll fly back home rolling down winding way.
Scare crows are all dressed in rags out at the edge of the field I lay
and all I've got's a pocket full of flowers on my grave.
Oh but summer is gone I remember it best
Back in the good old world.
Well I stood on the corner
Until my feet got wet
I stood by the faucet
Till the sink filled up
I stood by the window
Until the moon came up
My baby's bought a ticket
Long as my clothes line
Na na na na, nanana
Na na na na
My baby went and left me in a '49 Ford
Going down the highway in a 49 sword
My baby ripped my heart out
With every turn of the moon
Somebody told me
There's never been a rose without a thorn
Na na na na, nanana
Na na na
Well I'm just another sad guest
On this dark earth
And if I was a tree
I'd be a cut down tree
And if I was a bed
I'd be an unmade bed
I'll get my 3220 and it'll have to do
Na na na na, nanana
Na na na na
Gone like the wind in the meadow
And the rain on the hill
You even left your lipstick
And your powder and your blush
Baby gonna leave me
On a Grey Hound bus
The stars are melting
All across the sky
Na na na na, nanana
Na na na na
I let the dog out
But he didn't come back
Stood on the corner until
My feet got wet
Baby leave me in a '49 Ford
I stood by the window
Untill the moon came up
Na na na na, nanana
Na na na na
My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve at me
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere, I'm gonna
Lay my head, boys
I will call my home.
Well I see that
The world is upside down
My pockets were filled up with gold.
Now the clouds have covered o'er
And the wind is blowing cold
I don't need anybody
Because I learned to be alone
I lay my head, boys
I will call my home.
Bougainvillea's bloom and wind
Be careful mind the strangle vines
The rose is a climbing over blind
'Cause the sun is on the other side
The bees will find their honey
The sweetest every time
Around a Red Rose
I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
He’s an ol' altar boy
Lying out there in the street
He’s an ol' alter boy
Bound up in leather and chains
That’s why I’m feeling so blue
I'm an old altar boy
What about you?
Now, I can order in Latin
Make ‘em au gratin, Joe
I’m an old altar boy
That’s why I’m so depressed
I never got the rest of the dream
Just the ritual
Now I’m habitual
Majoring in crimes that are unspeakable
Cause I’m an old altar boy
That’s what happened to me.
I'm an old altar boy
He’s hoping he can meet a woman dressed like a nun
He knows there’s got to be some around here
Drinking across from the church
A little Father Cribari wine
On a Sunday morn' time.
I'm an old altar boy.
Why is he winking at this time in his life?
He never took a wife, cause he’s an old altar boy
What about you?
Holy Moses met the Pharaoh
Yeah, he tried to set him straight
Looked him in the eye, "Let my people go."
Holy Moses on the mountain
High above the golden calf
Went to get the Ten Commandments
He's just gonna break them in half
All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you
No one ever spoke to Noah
They all laughed at him instead
Working on his ark, working all by himself
Only Noah saw it coming
Forty days and forty nights
Took his sons and daughters with him
Yeah, they were the Israelites
All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The rain's gonna fall on you
Holy Father, what's the matter
Where have all your children gone
Sitting in the dark, living all by themselves
You don't have to hide anymore
All you zombies show your faces...
I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all aganist the sea
To have a better life
Marie you're the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
And all the world is green
The fase forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
And all the world is green
The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves
When all the world is green
You're the tree that you can't eat the fruit from
I heard horses came to ride me away
I want shade and a good place to shoot from
If it's a clock I'd be the end of the day
You know you're not the boss of me
You can lift your skirt, you can shake your hair
But I got all the time in the world
You're the ditch in the road where wheels keep spinning
You're the same dead cat, clawing its way back grinning
You know, you got a bad reputation and your nine lives way down the line
I got a jacket to put on and a hat to wear
I wouldn't waste a gallon on you out there
And I got all the time in the world
A bridge is only there for you to jump off of
And there ain't no rain clouds that are blue
I do declare my independence baby
I shot off all my fireworks for you
The river's burning and the trees are on fire
There's lots of good rubber left on these tires
And I've got all the time in the world
Baby, you're the light that won't change, that I got stuck at
You're the fan that won't work at the motel
They were all out of red so I got me a blue one
Baby, you're always using mine, why don't you get you one
I know you won't go very far, you left your blonde wig in the car
And I got all the time in the world
Well the time will come
When the wind will shout
All stripped down
All stripped down
And all the sinners know
What I'm talking about
All stripped down
All stripped down
When all the creatures of the world
Are gonna line up at the gate
And you better be on time
And you better not be late
All stripped down
Well you know in your heart
What you gotta bring
All stripped down
All stripped down
No big mink coat
No diamond ring
All stripped down
All stripped down
Well take off your paint
Take off your rouge
All stripped down
All stripped down
Let your backbone flip
And let your spirit shine through
I want you all stripped
All stripped down
All the men we got
Well they're goin' down the drain
All stripped down
All stripped down
And when I see your sadness
On a river of shame
All stripped down
All stripped down
You got to raise up
Bot the quick and the dead
All stripped down
All stripped down
With no shoes on your feet
No hat on your head
I want you all stripped down
All stripped down
Ain't nothin' in my heart
But fire for you
All stripped down
All stripped down
With my rainy hammer
And a heart that's true
I want you all stripped
All stripped down
It's dreamy weather we're on
You waved your crooked wand
Along an icy pond with a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows I saw
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond
They spell Alice
I disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere across the sea
There's a wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass on the tide
And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby all I can think of is Alice
Turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat?
How did the razor find my throat?
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier
And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
And I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice
And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
And I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice
There's only Alice
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down.
I'm a true believer, I'm a true believer, believer
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down.
If I ever get able, if I ever get able, able, to pay this debt I owe
Ain't goin' down
I ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down.
it's raining it's pouring
and you didn't bring a sweater
nebraska'll never let you come back home
and on hollywood and vine
by the trifty mart sign
and night i'll be willin' to bet
there's a young girl
with sweet little wishes
and pretty blue dreams
standin' there and gettin' all wet
now there's a place off the drag
called the gilbert hotel
there's a couple letters burned out the sign
and it's better then a bus stop
and they do good business
every time it rains
for sweet little girls
with nothing in their jeans
but sweet little wishes
and pretty blue dreams
now it's raining it's pouring
the old man is snoring
now i lay me down to sleep
i hear the sirens in the street
all the dreams are made of chrome
i have no way to get back home
i'd rather die before i wake
like marilyn monroe
and throw my dreams out in
the street and the
rain will make em grow
now the night clerk he got a club foot
and he's heard times or more
he says check out time is 10 am
and that's just what he means
and you go up the stairs
with sweet little wishes
and pretty blue dreams
now it's raining it's pouring
and hollywoods just fine
swindle a little out of her dreams
put a letter in the sign
never trust a scarecrow
wearin' shades after dark
be areful of that old bow tie he wears
it takes asweet little bullet
from a pretty blue gun
to put those scarlet ribbons in your hair
no that ain't no cherry bomb
4th of july's all done
just some fool playin' that a second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun
no that ain't no cherry bomb
4th of july's all done
get some fool playin' that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun.

hey i'll play you some pin ball hell you ain't got a chance
well then go on over and ask her to dance
The Ice Man's mule is parked
Outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers
Plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf
Dances with the buthcer's son
And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no one
They're dancing on the roof
ANd the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it wurth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one
The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride
She was 15 years old
And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last theing she said
Was, "I love you mom."
And a little rain
Never hurt no one
And a little rain
Never hurt no one
A good man's is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are goodbye
And my favorite color is red
I always play Russian Roulette in my head
It's sventeen black and twentynine red
How far from the gutter
How far fron the pew
I'll always remember to forget about you
A good man's is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are goodbye
And my favorite color is red
A long dead soldier looks out
From the frame
No one remembers his war no one
Remembers his name
Go out to the meadow
Scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here,
And nothing will grow
A good man's is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are goodbye
And my favorite color is red
Well it's ninth and hennepin
All the doughnuts have names that sound like prostitutes
And the moon's teeth marks are on the sky
Like a tarp thrown all over this
And the broken umbrellas like dead birds
And the steam comes out of the grill
Like the whole goddamn town's ready to blow...
And the bricks are all scarred with jailhouse tattoos
And everyone is behaving like dogs
And the horses are coming down violin road
And dutch is dead on his feet
And all the rooms they smell like diesel
And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept here
And I'm lost in the window, and I hide in the stairway
And I hang in the curtain, and I sleep in your hat...
And no one brings anything small into a bar around here
They all started out with bad directions
And the girl behind the counter has a tattooed tear
"one for every year he's away", she said
Such a crumbling beauty, ah
There's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix
She has that razor sadness that only gets worse
With the clang and the thunder of the southern pacific going by
And the clock ticks out like a dripping faucet
?til you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin
And you spill out over the side to anyone who will listen...
And I've seen it all, I've seen it all
Through the yellow windows of the evening train...
I plugged 16 shells from a thirtyoughtsix
And a black crow snuck through
A hole in the sky
So I spent all my buttons on an
Old pack mule
And I made me a ladder from
A pawn shop marimba
And I leaned it up against
A dandelion tree
And I filled me a sachel
Full of old pig corn
And I beat me a billy
From an old french horn
And I kicked that mule
To the top of the tree
And I blew me a hole
?bout the size of a kickdrum
And I cut me a switch
From a long branch elbow
I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin?
Black crow 16 shells from a thirtyoughtsix
Whittle you into kindlin?
Black crow 16 shells from a thirtyoughtsix
Well I slept in the holler
Of a dry creek bed
And I tore out the buckets
From a red corvette, tore out the buckets from a red corvette
Lionel and dave and the butcher made three
You got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
With the strings of a washburn
Stretched like a clothes line
You know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
Now I hold him prisoner
In a washburn jail
That stapped on the back
Of my old kick mule
Strapped it on the back of my old kick mule
I bang on the strings just
To drive him crazy
I strum it loud just to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
I plugged 16 shells from a thirtyoughtsix
and a Black Crow snuck through
a hole in the sky
so I spent all my buttons on an

Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak
Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin' it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.
Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
Well you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrellin' down the boulevard,
You're lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
Is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin' it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.
Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night
check this strange beverage that falls out from the sky,
splashin' bagdad on the hudson in panther martin's eyes,
he's high and outside wearin' candy apple red,
scarlet gave him twenty seven stitches in his head,
with a pint of green chartreuse ain't nothin' seems right,
you buy the sunday paper on a saturday night.
can't you hear the thunder someone stole my watch,
I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of scotch,
some one tell those chinamen on telegraph canyon road,
when you're on the bill with the spoon there ain't no time
to unload, so bye bye baby baby bye bye.
droopy stranger lonely dreamer toy puppy and the prado,
we're laughin' as they piled into olmos' el dorado,
jesus whispered eni meany miney moe,
they're too proud to duck their heads
that's why they bring it down so low,
so bye bye baby baby bye bye.
the pointed man is smack dab in the middle of july,
swingin' from the rafters in his brand new tie,
he said i can't go back to that hotel room
all they do is shout,
but i'll stay wichew baby till the money runs out,
so bye bye baby baby bye bye.
little black girl in a red dress
on a hothight with a broken shoe
little black girl you shoulde never left home
theres probly someone thats still waitin' up for you
its cold back in chicago
but in los angles its worse
when all you got is 29.00 and an alligator purse
i see already that vulture in the fleetwood
with the startruse hood
can see you're trying to get you bearrings
and you say hey which ways the main stem
and where ever you say you're from
he'll say he grew up there himself
and he'll comeon and make you feel
like you grew up right next door to him
and you say take a left on a central
cause you only got 29.00 and an alligator purse
and he'll come on like a gentleman
and you'll be a little shy
you say you ex old man was a sax player
he'll say baby i used to play bass for sly
and you say you like his cadillac, say honey, i got 2 or 3
he'll say sweetheart you're sure fortunate
that you ran into me
when you've done a dime in the joint
you figure nothin' could be worse
and you got 29.00 and an alligator purse
well he got pharoh on the 8 track
you start smokin' a little boo
you thinkin' gettin' outofchicago was the
best thing that ever happend to you
startin' to like it already
this cat seems to be cool
and he says honey i know a good hotel out in west hollywood
that'd be just right for you
but he ain't know good samaritan
he'll make sure he's reimursed
lot more than 29.00 and a alligator purse
now the sirens just an epilog
the cops here always get there too late
they always stop for coffee on the way to the scene of the crime
then they always try so hard to look just like movie stars
they couldnt catch a cold
you ony wasting you dime
and she's lucky to be alive
the doctor whispered to the nurse
she only lost a 12 pint of blood
29.00 and an alligator purse
They bought a round for the sailor
And they heard his tale
Of a world that was so far away
And a song that we'd never heard
A song of a little bird
That fell in love with a whale
He said, 'You cannot live in the ocean'
And she said to him
'You never can live in the sky'
But the ocean is filled with tears
And the sea turns into a mirror
There's a whale in the moon when it's clear
And a bird on the tide
Please don't cry
Let me dry your eyes
So tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend you're mine
Though I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart
Please don't cry
Let me dry your eyes
And tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend that you're mine
I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame.
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
Every since I put your picture
In a frame
I'm gonna love you
Till the wheels come off
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
And we can't be late
Kommiene, kommiene, kommiene, kommiene
Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did, I've got what I paid for now
See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open,
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger
In your silhouette window light go
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the onearmed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinamen, and the coldblooded signs,
And the girls down by the striptease shows, go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,
And the old men in wheelchairs know
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me
And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on an
Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers
And goodnight to Mathilda, too
